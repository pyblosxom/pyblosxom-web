"""
This plugin allows you to include the contents of a file as a variable.
This has some utility when reading in the output of a cronjob that pulls
data down or some other such thing.

It happs in cb_head and cb_foot--so you can use this variable in either
place.

To insert a file in your head or foot template, do the following::

    $util::include("filename")

where "filename" is replaced by the file name.  In most cases you will
want to provide an absolute path, however pyinclude will handle
relative paths and base them off of the template file.

Examples::

    $util::include("/home/willg/.plan")
    $util::include("desc.dsc")

In the first example, we will pull in the .plan file all the time.  In
the second example, we will pull in the desc.dsc file based on the
location of the template it's being sourced in by.  If there is
no such file, then we return "".


This plugin requires no configuration setup--you can drop it in your
plugin dir and it'll work out of the box.

It also handles evaluating python code blocks.  Enclose them in <% and %>
and use regular python.  The assumption is that only you can edit your
static files, so there are no restrictions.

For example:

<%
print "testing"
%>

<%
x = { "apple": 5, "banana": 6, "pear": 4 }
for mem in x.keys():
   print "<li>%s - %s</li>" % (mem, x[mem])
%>

To use things in the Request object, the variable name is "request":

<%
config = request.getConfiguration()
print config["datadir"]
%>
