   All flavours should be distributed as a series of templates in a
   .tar.gz or .zip file.  Make sure to include a README that states
   which plugins are required, any special installation instructions,
   any things to note, and a list of any and all authors who helped 
   to make the flavour.
</p>
<p>
   Include the stylesheet and any images that are required in the 
   .tar.gz/.zip file.
</p>
<p>
   After you submit this form, someone will contact you in regards
   to your flavour.  If there are problems with the entry, he/she
   will notify you then.  If everything is fine, then he/she will
   download the flavour .tar.gz/.zip file from the url you
   specified and place it in the repository.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Note:</b> the flavour should be your own work or you should have
   explicit approval from the authors.  If you find a flavour here
   that violates copyright or trademark stuff, send us an email with
   specific details to <b>pyblosxom-devel at lists dot sourceforge dot net</b>.
