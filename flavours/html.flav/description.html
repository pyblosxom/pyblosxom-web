<h1>
  Welcome!

<p>
  PyBlosxom is a lightweight file-based weblog system.  It originally started 
  out as a Python clone of <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blosxom</a> but 
  has since evolved into a beast of its own.  PyBlosxom focuses on three
  things: simplicity, extensibility, and community.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  <p>
    <b>simplicity</b> - PyBlosxom uses the file system for all its data storage.
    Because of this you can use whatever editor you want to use to create,
    update, and manipulate entries.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    <b>extensibility</b> - PyBlosxom has a plugin framework allowing you to build
    plugins in Python to augment and change PyBlosxom's default behavior.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    <b>community</b> - There are hundreds of PyBlosxom users out there all of
    whom have different needs.  PyBlosxom is used on a variety of operating
    systems in a variety of environments.  The pyblosxom users list shares
    their experiences, plugins, and expertise.
  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  PyBlosxom runs as a CGI script, under <a href="http://pythonpaste.org/">Paste</a>,
  and as a <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/">WSGI</a> application.
</p>
<p>
  As such, PyBlosxom is a pretty straight-forward system that allows you to do 
  the things you need to do without building everything from scratch.
