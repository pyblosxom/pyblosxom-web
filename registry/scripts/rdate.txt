Script for saving and loading the original posting date for an entry
in the entry metadata.

Filename may be given in commandline argument, if not so, program asks
for it. If dealing with file first time, program reads the modified-time
and stores it as a tag: #published %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S e.g. #published
2007-05-15 15:30:28 right after entry title line. The current
modified-time of file is preserved.

If run on the same file again and if the modified-time has been changed
since the time of tag storage, script restores the saved time (sets it
as the current modified-time). That's all.

Program is rather pyblosxom utility than plugin, so there is no reason
to move it to plugins dir.

There are many ways how to use the script. I personally use CVS as a
primary storage for blog entries. But there is problem - CVS does not
honor mtime. So, I run the rdate.py once on files before adding them to
CVS. Then i update blog from the repository, but, we know, cvs does it
without correct mtimes. So, after blog update I run the rdate.py on
files once more to restore saved time from #published tags. Simple bash
scripts does this automatically for me, so I care for blog entry times
no more.
