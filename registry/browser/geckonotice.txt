Checks the HTTP_USER_AGENT to see if it's a Gecko-based browser and if it 
isn't then it populates the $gecko_notice variable with a notice that the 
user should switch to Firefox with a link to http://www.mozilla.org/ .

Installation involves dropping the plugin into your plugindir, adding the 
plugin to the plugin list in your config.py file, and then adding $gecko_notice
to your head or foot template.
