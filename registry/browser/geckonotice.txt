  Checks the <tt>HTTP_USER_AGENT</tt> to see if it's a Gecko-based
  browser and if it isn't then it populates the
  <tt>$(gecko_notice)</tt> variable with a notice that the user should
  switch to Firefox with a link to http://www.mozilla.org/ .
</p>
<p>
  Installation involves dropping the plugin into your plugindir,
  adding the plugin to the plugin list in your <tt>config.py</tt>
  file, and then adding <tt>$(gecko_notice)</tt> to your head or foot
  template.
</p>
<p>
  Note: This plugin was written partially as an example on how to write
  plugins.  It's not a very serious plugin.
