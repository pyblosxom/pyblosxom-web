This plugin provides some misc method, and it is a xmlrpc plugin, so you need 
to install xmlrpc.py plugin first. This plugin provides these methods, just 
like: 
</p>
<p>
newedit.editCategory 
    you can edit the existing category, if the category is not existed, 
    it'll create a new one 
</p>
<p>
newedit.putFile 
    put file to blog 
</p>
<p>
newedit.getFileList 
    get file list which you'v uploaded 
</p>
<p>
newedit.getSysFile 
    get system file which you have the right 
</p>
<p>
newedit.putSysFile 
    put system file which you have the right 
</p>
<p>
(Editor's note: This just adds additional functions to the xmlrpc interface
but doesn't work with any blogging tools that we know of.)
