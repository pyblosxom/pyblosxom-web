This plugin provides some misc method, and it is a xmlrpc plugin, so you need 
to install xmlrpc.py plugin first. This plugin provides these methods, just 
like: 

newedit.editCategory 
    you can edit the existing category, if the category is not existed, 
    it'll create a new one 

newedit.putFile 
    put file to blog 

newedit.getFileList 
    get file list which you'v uploaded 

newedit.getSysFile 
    get system file which you have the right 

newedit.putSysFile 
    put system file which you have the right 

(Editor's note: This just adds additional functions to the xmlrpc interface
but doesn't work with any blogging tools that we know of.)
