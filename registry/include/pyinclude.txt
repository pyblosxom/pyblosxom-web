Allows you to include a file in your web-site verbatim.  I used to 
use this to add my .project file to the top of my blog by throwing a 
$util::include("/home/willg/.project") in my head template.

This requires absolute pathnames.

This plugin allows you to execute arbitrary Python in the included
file.
