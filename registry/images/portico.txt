Portico is an entry parser plugin for displaying small to medium size photo
galleries as a single blog entry. Portico blog entries are displayed in
three different ways, depending on the context:

 1. Displaying short series of thumbnails, whenever the entry is not
individually rendered at its permanent URL (e.g. on the front page of your
blog, amongst other entries).

 2. Displaying all the thumbnails for the collection, whenever the entry is
rendered at its permanent URL.

 3. Slideshow-like, displaying a larger version of the photo, possibly
including 'next' and 'previous' links to navigate though all the previews of
the collection.

It parses and renders blog entries that have a .port file extension. The
Portico blog entry file format is different from most other Pyblosxom entry
types in that it follows the simple '.ini' style syntax.
