Portico is an entry parser plugin for displaying small to medium size photo
galleries as a single blog entry. Portico blog entries are displayed in
three different ways, depending on the context:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Displaying short series of thumbnails, whenever the entry is not
individually rendered at its permanent URL (e.g. on the front page of your
blog, amongst other entries).
<li>Displaying all the thumbnails for the collection, whenever the entry is
rendered at its permanent URL.
<li>Slideshow-like, displaying a larger version of the photo, possibly
including 'next' and 'previous' links to navigate though all the previews of
the collection.
</ol>
<p>
It parses and renders blog entries that have a .port file extension. The
Portico blog entry file format is different from most other Pyblosxom entry
types in that it follows the simple '.ini' style syntax.
