PyBlosxom misses an important feature, namely to infer
the abstract of text bodies.  These are useful for different
typesetting, for generation of quickly overviewable abstracts
and (very important) for avoiding the flooding of RSS feeds
with complete articles.  This plugin recognisess an abstract
from an initial <blockquote/> paragraph in your story's body.
