A book review plugin for pyblosxom.

bookreview.py reads a database of book information and displays it in
three different ways:

1) On the main page you can list the last 5 books added to the DB
   by adding the $booklist variable
2) You can see a list of the books in your DB by going to
   /datadir/booklist.html
3) You can see individual reviews by clicking on the title of a book,
   or going to /datadir/booklist/?isbn=000000 (where 000000 is the isbn#)
