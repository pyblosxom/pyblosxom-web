<p>
  <b>bookreview</b> reads a database of book information and displays it in
  three different ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li>On the main page you can list the last 5 books added to the DB
   by adding the $booklist variable
<li>You can see a list of the books in your DB by going to
   <tt>/datadir/booklist.html</tt>
<li>You can see individual reviews by clicking on the title of a book,
   or going to <tt>/datadir/booklist/?isbn=000000</tt> (where 000000 is the 
   isbn#)
</ol>
