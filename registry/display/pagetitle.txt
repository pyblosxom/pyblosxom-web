pagetitle.py adds a new variable which will contain the standard
'blog_title_with_path' page title, unless there is only one entry in
view.  If there is only one entry in view, the page title is augmented 
with the story title as well.  This makes search engine results and browsers 
happier, as they can recognize what your page is about by the title!

The new variable you want to use is:

   $blog_title_with_path_or_entry_title
