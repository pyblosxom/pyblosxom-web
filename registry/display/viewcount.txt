  Keeps track of the number of times a given entry has been viewed. 
  It populates the <tt>$(viewcount)</tt> variable with this number for 
  display.  It adds one to the viewcount every time the entry is 
  viewed.  It stores the information in a pickled dict in your 
  content directory (or wherever you want).
