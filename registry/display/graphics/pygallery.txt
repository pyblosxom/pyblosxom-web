This is a gallery script that has good configuring
possibilities. All documentation is in the python source file you

   * can manage several galleries (three level design: gallery list,
     thumbs, image)

   * every gallery has a simple configuration file (index.cfg) that
     contain gallery name, summery text, image text, grouping images 
     etc.

   * common variables are set in config.py

   * there are special care has been taken for customizing row and
     items in the gallery list and the thumbs list.

   * the index.cfg file can be generated with apethumbgen.py
