This very simple plugin is designed to include advertisement 
text onto a page if, and only if the page request is referred 
from a search engine.  The idea is that a blog owner may want 
to show advertisements to those who have found the blog by 
searching but not to their core readership.  

In reality, the machinery is more general.  The plugin 
displays an arbitrary string on your blog if the referrer of 
the requests matches any of a set of patterns or regular 
expressions.
