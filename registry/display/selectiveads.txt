  This very simple plugin is designed to include advertisement text onto a 
  page if, and only if the page request is referred from a search engine.  
  The idea is that a blog owner may want to show advertisements to those 
  who have found the blog by searching but not to their core readership.

  In reality, the machinery is more general.  The plugin displays an 
  arbitrary string on your blog if the referrer of the requests matches 
  any of a set of patterns or regular expressions.
