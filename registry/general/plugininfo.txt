<p>
When users go to blog/plugin_info, they are greeted with complete 
information about all the plugins you're running in PyBlosxom.  It 
pulls the information from __author__, __version__, __url__, 
and the doc-string of the module.  It's helpful to others who are 
trying to figure out how you do some of the snazzy things you do.
