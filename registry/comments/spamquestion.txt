Description: 
spamquestion is a simple PyBlosxom plugin that helps to prevent 
comment spam.

A randomly selected question is shown on the comment form for a 
blog entry.  The user must answer the question correctly in order 
to submit a comment.  The approach works because each blog will use 
it's own set of unique questions that are easy for a human to deal 
with but are virtually impossible for a computer to answer unaided. 
This makes automated spambots ineffective.

Unlike CAPTCHA based anti-spam systems, this approach does not 
disadvantage visually impaired users and works even in text only 
browsers.

The question is written to the "spam_question" template variable. 
The user's answer is expected in a "spam_answer" form variable. 
These two items need to be integrated into the comment form template.

Requires: The "comments" plugin and the "session" plugin.
