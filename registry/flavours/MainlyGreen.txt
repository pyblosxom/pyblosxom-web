A pyblosxom version of my Movable Type templates, which were in turn inspired 
by an old blogger template. It's a two column CSS layout with content in the 
left column and links in the right, topped by a border containing the blog name.

You will find the home for this flavour at:

12-7-2007 - Adjusted the .tar.gz file and added a README with instructions
for installation.  (will guaraldi)

[NOTE: This needs to be updated/checked for PyBlosxom 1.5.]
