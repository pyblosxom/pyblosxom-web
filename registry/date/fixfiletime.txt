This is a quick script for fixing the atime/mtime for blog 
files. It's often the case that I misspell something or want to 
add an update, but because the timestamp for the blog entry comes 
from the mtime of the file, I screw it up and cause it to cycle 
to the top of my blog again. Rrrrr....

Anyhow, this allows you to quickly fix that.
