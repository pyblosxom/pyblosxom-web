  This is a script for fixing the atime/mtime for blog files.  It's often 
  the case that I misspell something or want to add an update, but because 
  the timestamp for the blog entry comes from the mtime of the file, 
  I screw it up and cause it to cycle to the top of my blog again.

  This allows you to quickly fix the mtime back.
