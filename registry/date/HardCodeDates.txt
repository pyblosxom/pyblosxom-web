  This plugin enables pyblosxom to look up entry timestamps in a global 
  timestamps file, instead of using the actual timestamp of the file.  I 
  did this mostly because I wanted to be able to use a version control system, 
  and be able to make corrections to entries without modifying the timestamps.
