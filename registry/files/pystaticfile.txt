Allows you to include static files in your blog without them actually 
being entries.  Static files lie in a separate directory from your content 
directory, but are pulled in using the same mechanisms entries are.  Thus 
you end up with a series of files that don't show up in archives, calendar,
categories, that are "static", and are formatted the same way your entries 
are.  It also allows you to do python script blocks within the static file. 
I use this for my "about the site" page and things of that nature.

Note, this has nothing to do with "static rendering".
