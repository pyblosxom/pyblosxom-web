filekicker handles requests for static files. if the static file named 
by the request URL exists in datadir, filekicker serves that file,
intact.  if not, it defers to pyblosxom.  the MIME type is inferred
from the file's extension.

for more information, see http://snarfed.org/space/filekicker .

filekicker is different from, but related to, plugins such as pystaticfile,
pyinclude, and imagekicker. it's basically a generalization of imagekicker.
(thanks magnus. :P)  feedback is welcome!
