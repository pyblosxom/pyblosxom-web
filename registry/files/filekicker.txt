  <b>filekicker</b> handles requests for static files.  If the static file 
  named by the request URL exists in datadir, filekicker serves that file,
  intact.  If not, it defers to pyblosxom.  The MIME type is inferred
  from the file's extension.

  <b>filekicker</b> is different from, but related to, plugins such as 
  pages, pyinclude, and imagekicker.  It's basically a generalization of 
  imagekicker.  (Thanks Magnus. :P)  Feedback is welcome!
