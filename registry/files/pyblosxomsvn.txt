  If you run a pyblosxom blog with auto-copied stories from SVN you are 
  probably interested in getting stable story dates that don't change every 
  time you update a story.  The date of the initial SVN log entry of a 
  story is something like the "day of birth" of a story, so it's a good 
  value to use.  Christopher Baus implemented a plugin for pyblosxom, 
  which looks overly complicated to me: it depends on memcached and 
  comes in two large python scripts.

  To simplify things I wrote this minimal replacement.
