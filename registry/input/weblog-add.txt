A web UI for submitting blosxom blogs via a web browser.

This is a CGI script that runs separately from PyBlosxom and requires
webserver authentication.

12/8/2007 - Verified by CanadaBear as part of GHOP that this script
works with PyBlosxom 1.4.2 with the following notes: The plugin does 
not work like a regular plugin - it runs as a seperate cgi script and
expects the web server to authenticate it. It works, but I think in 
the future it should be replaced. 
There's a webfront project which runs on top of PyBlosxom that will
replace weblog-add.  See <a href="https://launchpad.net/pyblosxom-webfront/">https://launchpad.net/pyblosxom-webfront/</a>.
