This plugin merges the work of two plugins by myself and Blake 
Winton. The comment uses the API of akismet.py and provides a 
simple plugin with callbacks appropriate for use in PyBlosxom. 
You use it, you must install aksimet.py and put it somewhere in 
the PYTHONPATH (e.g., in the PyBlosxom plugins directory). 
Additionally, the package now also contains a small command 
line utility for reporting any false negative comments as spam 
to the central akismet database and a short README file including 
documentation.
