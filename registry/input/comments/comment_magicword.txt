The Magic Word plugin is a way of preventing comment spam.  It is a bit like 
the nospam plugin, but much simpler and not as clever.  You pick a question, 
like "What is the opposite of hot?" and an answer, like "cold".  If the commenter 
can't answer the question, then their comment gets rejected.

True, this is low-tech, but it's probably good enough to stop comment spammers 
without hindering legitimate commenters, including those that are vision-impaired.  
It also has no dependencies other than the comments plugin, so it's an easy install.
