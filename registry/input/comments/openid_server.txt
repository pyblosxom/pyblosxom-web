This plug-in is an OpenID server. Specifically, it's an Identifier and an
Identity Provider. OpenID (http://openid.net/ ) is a distributed authentication
protocol, ie a single sign on platform, that uses URLs as identifiers. If you
have a PyBlosxom site, this plugin allows you to login anywhere that accepts
OpenID.

This plugin also implements the Simple Registration Extension, which lets you
optionally provide your name, email address, and other information
automatically to sites that you log into with OpenID.
