Comprehensive comments support for pyblosxom, includes files 
for trackback, pingback (requires xmlrpc plugin), commentAPI and 
standard form based comments.

It also supports a filtering callback so you can add your own filtering
plugins.

Note: This version and every version hereafter involves a change in
how the templates work.  <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2004/12/10#1168">Read
