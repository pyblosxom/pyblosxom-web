This plug-in adds support for OpenID (http://openid.net/ ) authentication for
posting comments to a Pyblosxom blog. In addition to allowing OpenID logins, it
also lets you grant or deny commenting based on the identity or server of the
commenter. For instance, you could restrict commenting to a select group of
friends, or to a list of servers that you trust to check out their users.
