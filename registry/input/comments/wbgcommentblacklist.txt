This plugin works in conjunction with the comments plugin (i.e. you need 
the comments plugin for this plugin to do anything).  This plugin allows 
you to reject comments that have words you have explicitly blacklisted in 
your config.py file.

Note: This is not a comprehensive solution to comment spam, but it can 
help in certain situations.  If it doesn't help you, don't use it.
