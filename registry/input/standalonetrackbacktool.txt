This plugin replaces the legacy $tb in older pyblosxoms <= 0.6

Since there is a proper plugin for feedback, this is deprecated as 
it uses the MovableType's Standalone Trackback Utility.  Since I have 
no idea how python can read perl's Storable data, to know if you've 
got a trackback or not means $tb is either a '+' or a '-'.
