This utility can be used to update a file entry while keeping 
the timestamp intact. This is very useful for blog entries that are 
time critical and you do not wish the time to get updated in any way.

Since this utility works like a wrapper for your favourite editor, 
replace the EDITOR line below to reflect the command to your 
favourite editor, be it nano, pico or bbedit, etc. Tested on un*x only.
