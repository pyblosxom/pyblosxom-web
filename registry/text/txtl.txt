PyTextile is a Python port of Textile, Dean Allen's Humane Web Text 
Generator. It supports all the features of the original, with the 
exception of converting high-bit characters to their HTML numeric 
entity equivalent.

See: <a href="http://diveintomark.org/projects/pytextile/index.html">http://diveintomark.org/projects/pytextile/index.html</a> for details.
