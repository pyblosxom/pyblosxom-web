<p>
ajax_search.js uses the Google AJAX Search API to do site search.  It's
similar to Google's existing site search, except that it shows the 
results within your site, not Google's.  It also degrades gracefully, 
by falling back to standard Google site search over HTTP for users who 
don't have JavaScript.
