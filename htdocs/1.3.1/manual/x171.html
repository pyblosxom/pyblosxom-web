>&#13;That gets pretty long and it's not very good looking.  Telling your mother
the URL over the phone would be difficult.  It would be nice if we could 
shorten it.
</P

>&#13;So, we have some options:
</P

></P

TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>&#13;Change the name of the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>pyblosxom.cgi</TT
> script. 
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;And if that's not good enough for you, use the Apache mod_rewrite module to get 
URLs internally redirected to the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>pyblosxom.cgi</TT
> script.
</P
></LI
></OL

>&#13;Both methods are described here in more detail.

you can use <TT

># this allows execution of CGI scripts in this directory
Options ExecCGI 
 
# if the user doesn't specify a file, then instead of doing the
# regular directory listing, we look at "blog" (which is our
# pyblosxom.cgi script renamed)
DirectoryIndex blog 
 
# this tells Apache that even though "blog" doesn't end in .cgi,
# it is in fact a CGI script and should be treated as such

>&#13;Apache has a module for URL rewriting which allows you to convert incoming
URLs to other URLs that can be handled internally.  You can do URL rewriting
based on all sorts of things.  See the Apache manual for more details.
</P
><P
>&#13;In our case, we want all incoming URLs pointing to <TT
CLASS="filename"
>blog</TT
> to 
get rewritten to <TT
CLASS="filename"
>cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi</TT
> so they can be handled 
by PyBlosxom.  Then all our URLs will look like this:
</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>http://www.joe.com/~joe/blog
http://www.joe.com/~joe/blog/an_entry.html
http://www.joe.com/~joe/blog/category1/another_entry.html 
</PRE
><P
>&#13;To do this, we create an .htaccess file (it has to be named exactly that)
in our <TT
CLASS="filename"
>public_html</TT
> directory (or wherever it is that /~joe/ 
points to).  In that file we have the following code:
</P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule    ^blog?(.*)$      /~joe/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi$1      [last]
</PRE
><P
>&#13;The first line turns on the Apache mod_rewrite engine so that it will rewrite
URLs.
</P
><P
>&#13;The second line has four parts.  The first part denotes the line as a 
RewriteRule.  The second part states the regular expression that matches 
the part of the URL that we want to rewrite.  The third part denotes what 
we're rewriting the URL to.  The fourth part states that after this rule 
is applied, no future rewrite rules should be applied.
</P
><P
>&#13;If you do URL rewriting, you may have to set the base_url property in your
<TT
CLASS="filename"
>config.py</TT
> accordingly.  In the above example, the 
<CODE
CLASS="varname"
>base_url</CODE
> would be <TT
CLASS="literal"
>http://www.joe.com/~joe/blog</TT
> 
with no trailing slash.
</P

>&#13;For more information on URL re-writing, see the Apache documentation.
