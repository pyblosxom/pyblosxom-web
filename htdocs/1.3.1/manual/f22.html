>&#13;The mission of this manual is to cover all aspects of using and developing for
PyBlosxom.  It is very much a work in progress and this manual is by no means
comprehensive at this point.  However, we do promise that the manual will get
better over time.
</P
><P
>&#13;This manual will always be free.  It's licensed under the GFDL.  The manual
is (poorly) version controlled along with the rest of PyBlosxom in the
CVS repository at SourceForge.  That's both a boon because everyone can
see the current state and also a pain in the ass because CVS doesn't allow
us to easily rename files and thus allow the manual to reorganize itself
as it continues to grow.
</P
><P
>&#13;There's no list of what's missing, however, there are a series of FIXMEs
placed around the document with some details as to what needs to be provided
and/or fixed.  I'm sure there are things missing that have been completely
overlooked as well.  This can change if someone wants to organize a list
of missing topics (which would then probably cause a reorganization of the
manual to account for those topics).
</P
><P
>&#13;If you want to help out with documentation, let us know on the pyblosxom-devel
mailing list.  If you notice errors, missing pieces, sections that are unclear, 
examples that are erroneous, or anything else, let us know on the 
pyblosxom-devel mailing list.
