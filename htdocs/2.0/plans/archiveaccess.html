<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In previous versions of PyBlosxom, any url which contained a path
segment of four digits was treated as a request for the archives for
that path.  This led to people attempting to create directories named,
say, &quot;1234&quot;, and having them not work, because the archive handler would
take over, and return no entries for the year 1234.</p>
<p>There are other plugins which assign different meanings to parts of the
path, but they all require the path to start with a prefix, thus
allowing the user to name their directories whatever they want.</p>
<p>This proposal is intended to sketch out how the archive access for the
next version of PyBlosxom should work, with the goals of allowing easy
access to the archives, as well as allowing users to name directories
whatever they like.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proposed-design">
<h1>Proposed design</h1>
<p>Currently, PyBlosxom jumps through some hoops to process numeric
directories as years.  While it does allow you to more easily view
archives of categories, I believe there is a simpler way to achieve the
same feature.</p>
<p>The path /dev/2003/ always contains the stuff in the /dev/2003 folder.</p>
<p>The items in the dev/2003 folder created in 2002 (Note: I'm using 2002
here for disambiguation, so that we know which part is the folder name,
and which part is the path.) could be:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>/archive/2002/dev/2003</li>
<li>/archive/2002?dev/2003</li>
<li>/dev/2003?archive/2002</li>
<li>/archive/2002/entries/dev/2003</li>
<li>/dev/2003/2002</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="discussion">
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>The main failings with options 2 and 3 are the use of the question mark.
Due to that, I suggest discounting them.</p>
<p>The next two options to consider are 1 and 4.  The trade-off between
those, as I see it, is that option 1 restricts what I can name my
top-level directories, (for instance, if you named your root directory
&quot;07&quot;, the url &quot;/archive/2002/07&quot;, could be either everything in the &quot;07&quot;
directory in 2002, or everything in the entire site in July 2002,)
whereas option 4 is too verbose for my liking.  The verbosity could be
fixed by choosing a shorter prefix, such as: /old/2002/&#64;/dev/2003, or
/&#64;/2002/in/dev/2003... For that matter, the prefix should probably come
out of config.py, like other prefixes, so that if the user decides to
have an &quot;old&quot;, or &quot;archive&quot; top-level category, they can change the
archive's prefix to &quot;previous&quot;, or &quot;ancient&quot;.  (Similarly, if the user
uses a different locale, they can name it &quot;Архив&quot;, or &quot;vieux&quot;, or
&quot;vorhergehend&quot;.)</p>
<p>Another proposed option would be to support filtering on any path by
appending date and path arguments.  I personally dislike this solution,
because it seems too complicated, and introduces more ways to mess up
(i.e. having a path with path components and a path argument).  It was
also noted by its proposer that it doesn't address the issue of wanting
to allow a path with a four digit number</p>
<p>The fifth option, which I completely forgot about at the time of
original writing, is to allow archive-based paths everywhere (if it
can't otherwise be construed as a directory).  So, /dev/2003 would be
the directory &quot;/dev/2003&quot; if it existed, and if not, the 2003 archive
for the directory &quot;/dev&quot;.  If you wanted the 2002 entries for the
/dev/2003 directory, you would type &quot;/dev/2003/2002&quot;, and if you wanted
the 2003 archives for the dev directory, you would be out of luck.  (But
that would have been a specific choice by the blog author, and so I feel
it's not unreasonable to say that.)</p>
