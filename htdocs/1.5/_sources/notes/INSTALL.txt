Installing PyBlosxom
====================

This guide walks through how to install PyBlosxom.

If this file doesn't meet your needs, ask us on the pyblosxom-users
mailing list or on IRC.  Information on both is on the website_.

.. _website: http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/

.. Note::

   If you're testing PyBlosxom, use ``virtualenv`` and deploy with
   Paste.  It'll save you a lot of time and it's easy to clean up
   afterwards.

.. Note::

   If you're upgrading from a previous version, make sure to read
   the Changelog.

Requirements
============

Minimally, PyBlosxom requires Python 2.3 to install.

PyBlosxom is well supported on GNU/Linux, works well on Mac OS X,
and might work on Windows.

PyBlosxom works with any web-server as a CGI application, works as a
WSGI application, and might work in other contexts.


Install
=======

Installing in a virtual environment
-----------------------------------

If you want to install PyBlosxom for a single user or want to install
it in a virtual environment where it can't get naughty with your
system installation of Python, use `virtualenv`_.

1. Install virtualenv::

      easy_install virtualenv

      pip install virtualenv

2. Build a virtual environment in the directory specified by
   ``<dest_dir>``::

      virtualenv --no-site-packages <dest_dir>

3. Activate your virtual environment::

      <dest_dir>/usr/bin/activate

4. Install PyBlosxom using one of the instructions below.

.. _virtualenv: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv


Installation
------------

*Installing with distribute and pip*

If you have `distribute`_ and `pip`_ installed and want to do a
site-wide installation, do::

   pip install pyblosxom

.. _distribute: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute
.. _pip: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip


*Installing with setuptools and easy_install*

If you have `setuptools`_ installed and want to do a site-wide
installation, do::

   easy_install pyblosxom

.. _setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools


*Installing from a tarball*

You can install PyBlosxom from a tarball.

Tarballs are at http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/download/ .

Extract the ``tar.gz`` file and run::

   python setup.py install

If you're installing PyBlosxom for development, do::

   python setup.py develop


*Installing from a git clone*

We develop PyBlosxom using git.  You can clone the git repository and
install PyBlosxom from that.

Instructions for cloning the git repository are at
http://gitorious.org/pyblosxom/ .

Generally, master is unstable, but any of the tags are stable.

After you've cloned the repository, run::

   python setup.py install

If you're installing PyBlosxom for development, do::

   python setup.py develop


*None of these methods works for me*

If none of those methods works for you, talk to us on pyblosxom-users
mailing list or on IRC.


Creating a blog
===============

To create a blog, do::

   pyblosxom-cmd create ./blog/

That generates the directory structure, required files, and a first
post in the ``./blog/`` directory.


Deploying
=========

We use the word "deploy" to cover the steps and setup required to turn
your blog into a web-site.  This could be any of the following:

1. static rendering where your blog is compiled into a set of HTML pages
2. running your blog as a CGI program
3. running your blog as a WSGI application
4. some fourth thing!

The PyBlosxom documentation covers some of these deployment options.
If you want to deploy your blog in a way that's not covered in the
documentation, ask on the pyblosxom-users mailing list or on IRC.


Post-install
============

After you finish installing PyBlosxom, you should sign up on the
*pyblosxom-users* `mailing list`__.

__ https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pyblosxom-users

Additionally, please hop on the ``#pyblosxom`` IRC channel on
``irc.freenode.net`` and say hi.  It'll almost certainly help you get
acquainted with PyBlosxom and it'll reduce the amount of time it takes
to get your blog up and going.
