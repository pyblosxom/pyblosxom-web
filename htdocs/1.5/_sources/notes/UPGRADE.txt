=====================
 Upgrading PyBlosxom
=====================

This walks through upgrading PyBlosxom from a previous version.


Before upgrading
================

First, read through the changelog which includes pointers to users and
plugin developers regarding changes between older versions and newer
versions.

The changelog is in the ``CHANGELOG`` file.

If you're reading this online, the changelog is :ref:`here <changelog>`.

To be safe, install PyBlosxom locally and test your blog configuration
and plugins to make sure everything works with the new version.


System-wide upgrade
===================

At the command line, type::

    easy_install -U pyblosxom


Individual upgrade
==================

Download the new PyBlosxom ``.tar.gz`` file, extract it and point your
scripts to the directory of the new version.
