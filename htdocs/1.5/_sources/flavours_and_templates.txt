Flavours and Templates
======================

Summary
=======

PyBlosxom renderers take a bunch of entries and data accumulated over
the course of handling the request and renders it into some kind of
output which is delivered to the browser.

Output can be in a variety of text-based formats: html, xhtml, xml,
etc.

PyBlosxom comes with two renderers: blosxom and debug.

The debug renderer displays all the data in the various parts of the
PyBlosxom Request object.  This is really helpful to see what
variables are at your disposal and also to debug problems you might be
having with plugins you've installed.

The blosxom renderer renders entries just like Blosxom does.

The renderer can be set in your config file like this::

   py["renderer"] = "blosxom"

The blosxom renderer is the default renderer, so if you don't specify
a renderer, then the blosxom renderer is used.

If you want your blog rendered using a different template system--say
Cheetah or htmltmpl--implement a renderer that renders the output.
This new renderer can be implemented as a PyBlosxom plugin.  See the
chapter on writing plugins for more information.

The rest of this chapter talks about the various things you can do with
the blosxom renderer which comes with PyBlosxom.



Flavours and Templates
======================

The blosxom renderer renders the output of a request with a
:term:`flavour`.

A :term:`flavour` is a group of templates for a specific output format
or style.  For example, html, xhtml, atom, rss, rdf, etc.

A :term:`template` is a small bit of a flavour that specifies a
specific portion of the output.  For example, the head of an html page
is a template.

A flavour consists of at least the following templates:

* **content_type** - holds the content type of the flavour
* **head** - holds everything before all the entries
* **story** - holds a single entry
* **foot** - holds everything after all the entries
* **date_head** - shows at the start of a date
* **date_foot** - shows at the end of a date

.. Note::

   Many plugins require additional templates to render their output in
   addition ot the standard templates listed above.  See the
   documentation for the plugin for more information.

PyBlosxom allows you to manage the flavours and templates for your
blog in several different ways:

1. in directories in the flavourdir, OR
2. in directories in the datadir, OR
3. in the datadir along with your entries.

.. Note::

   PyBlosxom is backwards compatible with previous versions of
   PyBlosxom.  You can put your flavour files iny our datadir.  You
   can also put your flavour files in the categories of your datadir.
   However you cannot have a flavourdir and put flavour files in your
   datadir--PyBlosxom will look at EITHER your datadir OR your
   flavourdir for flavour files.


Storing flavours in the flavourdir
----------------------------------

This is the easiest way to store your flavours separately from the
entries in your blog.  It is the preferred way.

If you specify the ``flavourdir`` directory in your ``config.py`` file,
you can store each flavour in a directory in the flavourdir.

For example, if your ``config.py`` file had this::

   py["flavourdir"] = "/home/joe/blog/flavours/"

Then the blog directory structure might look like this::

   /home/joe/blog/
             |- entries/             <-- datadir
             |  |- work/             <-- work category of entries
             |  |- home/             <-- home category of entries
             |
             |- flavours/
                |- html.flav/        <-- html flavour
                |  |- content_type
                |  |- head
                |  |- foot
                |  |- story
                |  |- ...
                |
                |- rss.flav/         <-- rss flavour
                |  |- content_type
                |  |- head
                |  |- foot
                |  |- story
                |  |- ...
                |
                |- work/
                   |- html.flav/     <-- html flavour for the work category
                   |- ...


You can parallel the category directories in your datadir allowing you
to have different flavours apply to different directories.  In the
example above, the work category has a different html flavour than the
root and home categories.

This structure also makes it easier to use flavour packs found in the
flavour registry on the `PyBlosxom website`_.

.. _PyBlosxom website: http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/

.. Note::

   Flavour directories must end in ``.flav``.

.. Note::

   Templates in the flavour directory don't need an extension.


Storing flavours in flavour directories in the datadir
------------------------------------------------------

Flavours can be stored in directories in the directory specified by
your datadir.  This works similarly to the flavourdir method except
that the flavourdir is not a separate directory tree--it's the same as
your datadir.

In this way your entries are intermixed with your flavour directories.

.. Note::

   Flavour directories must end in ``.flav``.


Storing flavours in the datadir
-------------------------------

You can also put flavour templates alongside the blog entries.  If you
do this, then the flavour template files must end in the flavour name.

The template files for a given flavour all have the same file
extension which is the flavour's name.  For example, if you were using
an "html" flavour, the flavour itself would be composed of the
following files:

* ``content_type.html``
* ``head.html``
* ``story.html``
* ``foot.html``
* ``date_head.html``
* ``date_foot.html``

If you want to create a "joy" flavour, you would have the following
files:

* ``content_type.joy``
* ``head.joy``
* ``story.joy``
* ``foot.joy``
* ``date_head.joy``
* ``date_foot.joy``

.. Warning::

   If you intermix flavour templates with entries, then one thing you
   need to be aware of is creating a flavour where the name is the
   same as the extension of your blog entries.

   For example, if ``.txt`` is the extension for entries in your blog,
   don't create a **txt** flavour!


Included flavours
=================

PyBlosxom comes with the following flavours:

* ``html`` - a basic html flavour
* ``rss`` - an RSS 2.0 flavour for syndication
* ``atom`` - an Atom 1.0 flavour for syndication

These flavours are included with PyBlosxom and they will work out of the
box with no modifications and no configuration changes.


Overriding included flavours
============================

You can override all or portions of the included flavours by providing
the template files you want to override in your flavourdir (or
datadir).

For example::

   blog/
     |- flavours/
        |- html.flav
           |- head

When rendering the ``html`` flavour, the ``head`` template will be
taken from ``flavours/html.flav/`` and the rest of the templates will
be taken from the included html flavour.

Second example::

   blog/
     |- entries/
     |  |- math/
     |
     |- flavours/
        |- html.flav/
        |  |- content_type
        |  |- head
        |  |- date_head
        |  |- story
        |  |- date_foot
        |  |- foot
        |
        |- math/
           |- html.flav/
              |- story

If the request is for an entry in the math category, then the ``story``
file will be taken from the ``flavours/math/html.flav/`` directory and
the rest of the templates will be taken from ``flavours/html.flav/``.


Finding new flavours
====================

There is a flavour registry on the `PyBlosxom website`_.  You can find
flavours here that have been created by other people and submit
flavours that you've created and want to share.

.. _PyBlosxom website: http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/

Additionally, you can use flavours from `Blosxom`_ and themes from
`WordPress`_ after spending some time converting them.

.. _Blosxom: http://www.blosxom.com/
.. _WordPress: http://wordpress.org/

The order of overiding works like this:

1. PyBlosxom looks for flavour files that came with PyBlosxom
2. PyBlosxom starts at the root of the flavourdir and looks for
   flavour files there.  If there are some, then these files override
   the files PyBlosxom has found so far.
3. PyBlosxom iterates through category directories in the flavourdir
   if there are any that are parallel to the datadir and looks for
   flavour directories there.  If there are some, then those files
   override the files it has so far.

This allows you to easily override specific templates in your blog
(like the header or footer) depending on what category the user is
looking at.


Template Variables
==================

This is the list of variables that are available to your templates.
Templates contain variables that are expanded when the template is
rendered.  Plugins may add additional variables--refer to plugin
documentationfor a list of which variables they add and in which
templates they're available.


Syntax
------

To use a variable in a template, prefix the variable name with a $.
For example, this would expand to the blog's title as a h2::

   <h2>$title</h2>

PyBlosxom 1.4.3 and later support parenthesized variables, too::

   <h2>$(title)</h2>

This reduced ambiguity.

PyBlosxom 1.5 also supports variables that expand into functions which
are evaluated::

   <h2>$(escape(title))</h2>


Getting a complete list of variables
------------------------------------

To get a complete list of what variables are available in your blog,
use the debug renderer by changing the value of the ``renderer``
property in your ``config.py`` file to ``debug`` like this::

   py["renderer"] = "debug"


That will tell you all kinds of stuff about the data structures
involved in the request.  Don't forget to change it back when you're
done!



URL Encoding and Escaping of Template Variables
-----------------------------------------------

PyBlosxom 1.5 and later has two filters allowing for escaped and
urlencoded values:

* ``$escape(title)`` - escapes ``$title``
* ``$urlencode(title)`` - urlencoded ``$title``


Plugins can add additional filters.

.. Note::

   PyBlosxom versions 1.3 and 1.4 escaped and urlencoded variables
   that ended with ``_escaped`` and ``_urlencoded``.

   Deprecated in PyBlosxom 1.5.


Variables from config.py
------------------------

Anything in your ``config.py`` file is a variable available to all of
your templates.  For example, these standard properties in your
``config.py`` file are available:

* ``blog_description``
* ``blog_title``
* ``blog_language``
* ``blog_encoding``
* ``blog_author``
* ``blog_email``
* ``base_url`` (if you provided it)
* ...


Additionally, any other properties you set in ``config.py`` are
available in your templates.  If you wanted to create a
``blog_images`` variable holding the base url of the directory with
all your images in it::

   py["blog_images"] = "http://www.joe.com/~joe/images/"


to your ``config.py`` file and it would be available in all your
templates.


Calculated template variables

Also, any variables created by plugins that are entry-centric and any
variables that come from metadata in the entry are available.  See
those sections in this document for more details.


Template Variables from Plugins
-------------------------------

Many plugins will create additional variables that are available in
templates.  Refer to the documentation of the plugins that you have
installed to see what variables are available and what they do.


Template Variables from Entry Metadata
--------------------------------------

You can add metadata to your entries on an individual basis and this
metadata is available to your story templates.

For example, if I had a blog entry like this::

   First Post!
   #mood happy
   #music The Doors - Break on Through to the Other Side
   <p>
     This is the first post to my new PyBlosxom blog.  I've
     also got two metadata items in it which will be available
     as variables!
   </p>


You'll have two variables ``$mood`` and ``$music`` that will also be
available in your story templates.



Invoking a Flavour
==================

The flavour for a given page is specified in the extension of the file
being requested.  For example:

* ``http://some.blog.org/`` - 
  brings up the index in the default flavour which is "html"

* ``http://some.blog.org/index.html`` - 
  brings up the index in the "html" flavour

* ``http://some.blog.org/index.rss`` -
  brings up the index in the "rss" flavour (which by default is RSS 0.9.1)

* ``http://some.blog.org/2004/05/index.joy`` -
  brings up the index for May of 2004 in the "joy" flavour


Additionally, you can specify the flavour by adding a ``flav``
variable in the query-string.  Examples:

* ``http://some.blog.org/`` -
  brings up the index in the default flavour which is "html"

* ``http://some.blog.org/?flav=rss`` -
  brings up the index in the "rss" flavour

* ``http://some.blog.org/2004/05/index?flav=joy`` -
  brings up the index for May of 2004 in the "joy" flavour


Setting Default Flavour
=======================

You can change the default flavour from ``html`` to some other flavour
in your ``config.py`` file with the ``default_flavour`` property::

   py["default_flavour"] = "joy"


Doing this will set the default flavour to use when the URI the user
has used doesn't specify which flavour to use.

This url doesn't specify the flavour to use, so it will be rendered
with the default flavour::

   http://www.joe.com/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi/2005/03

This url specifies the flavour, so it will be rendered with that
flavour::

   http://www.joe.com/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi/2005/03/?flav=html


Order of Operations to Figure Out Which Flavour to Use
======================================================

We know that you can specify the default flavour to use in the
``config.py`` file with the ``default_flavour`` property.  We know
that the user can specify which flavour to use by the file extension
of the URI.  We also know that the user can specify which flavour to
use by using the ``flav`` variable in the query string.

The order in which we figure out which flavour to use is this:

1. look at the URI extension: if the URI has one, then we use that.
2. look at the ``flav`` querystring variable: if there is one, 
   then we use that.
3. look at the ``default_flavour`` property in the ``config.py`` 
   file: if there is one, then we use that.
4. use the ``html`` flavour.



Examples of Templates
=====================

For examples of templates and flavours, see the included flavours that
come with your PyBlosxom installation.
