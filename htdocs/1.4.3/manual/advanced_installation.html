<p>We encourage you not to try any of this until you've gotten a blog up
and running.</p>
<p>This chapter covers additional advanced things you can do to your blog
that will make it nicer.  However, they're not necessary and they're
advanced and we consider these things to be very much a &quot;you're on
your own&quot; kind of issue.</p>
<p>If you ever have problems with PyBlosxom and you ask us questions on
the <a class="reference external" href="mailto:pyblosxom-users&#64;lists.sourceforge.net">pyblosxom-users</a> or <a class="reference external" href="mailto:pyblosxom-devel&#64;lists.sourceforge.net">pyblosxom-devel</a> mailing lists, make sure
you explicitly state what things you've done from this chapter.  It'll
go a long way in helping us to help you.</p>
<div class="section" id="renaming-the-pyblosxom-cgi-script">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Renaming the pyblosxom.cgi Script</a></h1>
<p>In the default installation, the PyBlosxom script is named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyblosxom.cgi</span></tt>.</p>
<p>For a typical user on an Apache installation with user folders turned
on, PyBlosxom URLs could look like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://www.joe.com/~joe/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi
http://www.joe.com/~joe/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi/an_entry.html
http://www.joe.com/~joe/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi/programming/another_entry.html
</pre>
<p>That gets pretty long and it's not very good looking.  For example, telling
the URL to your mother or best friend over the phone would be challenging.
It would be nice if we could shorten and simplify it.</p>
<p>So, we have some options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Change the name of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyblosxom.cgi</span></tt> script.</li>
<li>And if that's not good enough for you, use the Apache mod_rewrite
module to get URLs internally redirected to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyblosxom.cgi</span></tt>
script.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both methods are described here in more detail.</p>
<div class="section" id="change-the-name-of-the-pyblosxom-cgi-script">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Change the Name of the pyblosxom.cgi Script</a></h2>
<p>There's no reason that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyblosxom.cgi</span></tt> has to be named
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyblosxom.cgi</span></tt>.  Let's try changing it from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pyblosxom.cgi</span></tt> to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blog</span></tt>.  Now our example URLs look like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://www.joe.com/~joe/cgi-bin/blog
http://www.joe.com/~joe/cgi-bin/blog/an_entry.html
http://www.joe.com/~joe/cgi-bin/blog/category1/another_entry.html
</pre>
<p>That's better looking in the example.  In your specific circumstances,
that may be all you need.</p>
<p>You might have to change the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">base_url</span></tt> property in your
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config.py</span></tt> file to match the new URL.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>A note about the base_url:</p>
<p class="last">The base_url property should NOT have a trailing slash.</p>
</div>
<p>If you're running on Apache, you might have to tell Apache that this
is a CGI script even if it doesn't have a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.cgi</span></tt> at the end of it.
If you can use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.htaccess</span></tt> files to override Apache settings, you
might be able to do something like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# this allows execution of CGI scripts in this directory
Options ExecCGI

# if the user doesn't specify a file, then instead of doing the
# regular directory listing, we look at &quot;blog&quot; (which is our
# pyblosxom.cgi script renamed)
DirectoryIndex blog

# this tells Apache that even though &quot;blog&quot; doesn't end in .cgi,
# it is in fact a CGI script and should be treated as such
&lt;Files blog&gt;
ForceType application/cgi-script
SetHandler cgi-script
&lt;/Files&gt;
</pre>
<p>You may need to stop and restart Apache for your Apache changes to
take effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hiding-the-cgi-with-rewriterule">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Hiding the .cgi with RewriteRule</a></h2>
<p>Apache has a module for URL rewriting which allows you to convert
incoming URLs to other URLs that can be handled internally.  You can
do URL rewriting based on all sorts of things.  See the Apache manual
for more details.</p>
<p>In our case, we want all incoming URLs pointing to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blog</span></tt> to get
rewritten to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi</span></tt> so they can be handled by
PyBlosxom.  Then all our URLs will look like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://www.joe.com/~joe/blog
http://www.joe.com/~joe/blog/an_entry.html
http://www.joe.com/~joe/blog/category1/another_entry.html
</pre>
<p>To do this, we create an .htaccess file (it has to be named exactly
that) in our <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">public_html</span></tt> directory (or wherever it is that /~joe/
points to).  In that file we have the following code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule   ^blog?(.*)$   /~joe/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi$1   [last]
</pre>
<p>The first line turns on the Apache mod_rewrite engine so that it will
rewrite URLs.</p>
<p>The second line has four parts.  The first part denotes the line as a
RewriteRule.  The second part states the regular expression that
matches the part of the URL that we want to rewrite.  The third part
denotes what we're rewriting the URL to.  The fourth part states that
after this rule is applied, no future rewrite rules should be applied.</p>
<p>If you do URL rewriting, you may have to set the base_url property in
your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config.py</span></tt> accordingly.  In the above example, the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">base_url</span></tt> would be <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://www.joe.com/~joe/blog</span></tt> with no
trailing slash.</p>
<p>For more information on URL re-writing, see the Apache documentation (<a class="reference external" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html">1.3</a>,
