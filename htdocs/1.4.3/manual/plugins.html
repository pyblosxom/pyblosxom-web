<p>PyBlosxom allows you to extend and augment its base functionality using
PyBlosxom plugins.  Plugins allow you to create additional variables; provide
additional entry parsers, renderers, post-formatters, and pre-formatters;
create new output data types; pull information from other non-blog sources;
create images; and a variety of other things.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-pyblosxom-up-to-use-plugins">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Setting PyBlosxom up to Use Plugins</a></h1>
<p>There are two properties in your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config.py</span></tt> file that affect the behavior
for loading plugins.</p>
<p>The first one is the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plugin_dirs</span></tt> property which is a list of
strings specifying all the directories you might have plugins.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
py[&quot;plugin_dirs&quot;] = [&quot;/home/will/pybloxsom/plugins&quot;]
</pre>
<p>This will cause PyBlosxom to look in this specific directory for plugins.</p>
<p>The other property is the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load_plugins</span></tt> property.  If you don't have this
set at all (i.e. it's either not in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config.py</span></tt> file or the line is
commented out), PyBlosxom will load all plugins it finds in the plugin
directories you've specified.  It will look in each directory in order as
you've specified.  It will load the plugins in each directory in alphabetical
order by filename.</p>
<p>The other way to load plugins is by specifying the plugins explicitly by
setting the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load_plugins</span></tt> property.  PyBlosxom will load only the plugins
you've specified and will load them in the order you've specified.  The
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load_plugins</span></tt> property takes a list of strings.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
py[&quot;load_plugins&quot;] = [&quot;calendar&quot;, &quot;category&quot;, &quot;booklist&quot;]
</pre>
<p>This will load the plugins whose filenames are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">calendar.py</span></tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">category.py</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">booklist.py</span></tt>.  It will only load those plugins even
if other plugins are in the directory and it will load them in that order.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finding-plugins">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Finding Plugins</a></h1>
<p>You can find plugins in the <a class="reference external" href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/registry/">PyBlosxom plugin registry</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, some people write plugins, but never register with the plugin
registry. Sometimes this is because the author doesn't feel the plugin is
finished for public consumption. Even so, it might meet your needs. The best
way to find these plugins is to ask on the pyblosxom-users mailing list for
a plugin that has the functionality you desire.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installing-plugins">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Installing Plugins</a></h1>
<p>When you're installing a plugin, refer to its documentation.  The
documentation could be in a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">README</span></tt> file, but more commonly it's in the
plugin code itself at the top of the file.  This documentation should tell
you how to install the plugin, what template variables the plugin exposes,
how to invoke the plugin, how to get in touch with the author should you
find bugs or need help, and any additional things you should know about.</p>
<p>Most plugins should have a pretty easy installation method. You should be
able to copy the plugin into the directory defined in your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config.py</span></tt>
file in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plugin_dirs</span></tt> property.  Then there might be some additional
properties you'll have to set in your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">config.py</span></tt> file to define the
plugin's behavior.  That should be about it.  On some occasions, you may
have to change the code in the plugin itself to meet your specific needs.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>A note about Apache, no suexec, .pyc files, and permission problems:</p>
<p>If you're not running suexec, then Apache may not be able to generate
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.pyc</span></tt> files for your plugins.  This may result in your plugins
failing to load.</p>
<p>If that happens, you should run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">./pyblosxom.cgi</span></tt> in your shell to
generate the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.pyc</span></tt> files.</p>
<p class="last">Every time you install a new plugin or change an existing plugin,
you'll need to remove the existing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.pyc</span></tt> files and regenerate
them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing-your-own-plugins">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Writing Your Own Plugins</a></h1>
<p>You may find that you desire functionality and there is no plugin that anyone
knows about that performs that functionality.  It's probably best at this
point for you to ask someone to write the plugin you need or write it
yourself.</p>
<p>PyBlosxom plugins are fairly easy to write and can cover a lot of really
different functionality.  The best way to learn how to write PyBlosxom
plugins is to read through the plugins in the plugin registry.  Many of them
are well written and may provide insight as to how to solve your specific
problem.</p>
<p>If you plan on writing your own plugin, refer to the manual file on
writing PyBlosxom plugins.</p>
<p>Additionally, feel free to ask for help on the pyblosxom-users and
pyblosxom-devel mailing lists.</p>
