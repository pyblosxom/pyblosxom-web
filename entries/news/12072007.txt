GHOP and PyBlosxom
#published 2007-12-07 17:22:52
<p>
  PyBlosxom is participating under 
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-highly-open-participation-psf/">the 
  PSF in Google Highly Open Participation</a> and it's been a huge help for
  our project.
</p>
<p>
  In the first week, PyBlosxom had four tasks all focused on testing plugins
  in the PyBlosxom registry with PyBlosxom 1.4.2, reporting/fixing issues,
  adding documentation, ...  From that we've updated five plugin entries:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/registry/display/graphics/pygallery">pygallery</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/registry/input/contact">contact</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/registry/filtering/filter">filter</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/registry/general/autoping">autoping</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/blog/registry/general/latest">latest</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
  Many thanks to darkmessenger and CanadaBear for their work!
</p>
<p>
  There are two plugin-status related tasks left in GHOP (both expired today)
  and four new tasks focusing on performance testing PyBlosxom and writing code
  in the wake of changes for PyBlosxom 2.0.
</p>
<p>
  Ryan and I are writing up a task for continued work on unit tests in PyBlosxom.
  I'll be adding that as a task in the next round of adding tasks.
</p>  
<p>
  Additionally, this project has given me some ideas on how to better organize 
  outstanding tasks so that it's easier for people to figure out how to help out.
  I'll be working on that going forward as well.
