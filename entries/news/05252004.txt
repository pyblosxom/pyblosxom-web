PyBlosxom 1.0 released!
#published 2004-05-25 19:20:00
<p>
  We've cleaned up a lot code and documentation and fixed a lot of bugs. 
  We've stabilized the API and added static rendering. In short, this 
  should be a pretty solid 1.0 milestone for PyBlosxom.

<p>
  I encourage people to upgrade. When you untar the distribution tarball, 
  read through INSTALL and README. These files will walk you through 
  installation and upgrading from 0.9.
