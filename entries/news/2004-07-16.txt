PyBlosxom todo list posted
#published 2004-07-16 19:20:00
<p>
  I posted my todo list (culled from who-knows-what sources) on the wiki 
  because I'm no longer doing active development.
</p>
<p>
  Anyone who is interested in doing PyBlosxom development and want something 
  to work on could work on items on the list.
</p>
<p>
  Anyone who wants things implemented (plugins included), should add things 
  to the todo list.
</p>
<p>
  Just know that if we have lots of people adding todo items and no one 
  working on them then nothing will get done. I encourage people who are 
  adding items to work on completing other items. More details on this page:

  That's about it. 1.0.1 coming soon--mostly when I get around to releasing 
  it.

  Rock on!
