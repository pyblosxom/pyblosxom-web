<p>
  After a significant number of years (since approx 2003) running PyBlosxom, willg has stepped down from managing the project and 
  passed it over to me, Akai.<br>
  will, thank you for your considerable effort in making PyBlosxom the program we know and love today.<br>
  <br>
  I'm available on the mailing lists and frequently on the IRC channel (as AkaiKitsune) for any question or issue I can help with.<br>
  Part of the handoff is the move from the bluesock.org domain to github for both the site and the repositories.<br>
  Update your bookmarks to http://pyblosxom.github.com/, that's our new home!
