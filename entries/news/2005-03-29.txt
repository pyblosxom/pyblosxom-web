Site updates and PyBlosxom's future plans

  I did a quick update to the links on the menu bar of the web-site (you 
  can see the menu bar to the left there).  We need to maintain separate 
  versions of the documentation for prior versions of PyBlosxom and it was
  getting messy so I moved all documentation links to the new 
  <a href="/blog/static/documentation.html">documentation page</a>.
  Hopefully it's clear enough for new users and old users alike.
</p>
<p>
  The list of things we've been thinking about doing for PyBlosxom is 
  really long and contains items that have been fleshed out as well as 
  items that haven't been fleshed out at all and are currently just 
  looking for someone to do some more analysis.  I'm going to take my 
  notes and dump a bunch of "feature requests" in the feature tracker 
  on the SourceForge section.  The trackers are mildly crappy, but it's 
  better than spending the time right now to build something on our own.
</p>
<p>
  The plan right now is to let PyBlosxom 1.2 simmer a bit and shake out 
  some of the issues it might have.  Additionally, I'm going to try to 
  spend some more time on fleshing out the manual and fixing up the 
  contributed plugins that I either wrote or had a hand in writing.
</p>
<p>
  We've got some ideas about what the next version will entail, but
  nothing is set in stone.  It's likely we'll know more in a month.
</p>
<p>
  And lastly, Planet PyBlosxom is no more.  I had the domain name for
  a year and ran the site, but then decided I didn't want to run it
  any more.  At some point, I'll set up something on here, but it's
  low-ish on my todo list at the moment.

<p>
  I think that about covers it for this status update.
