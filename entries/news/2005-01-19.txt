  I added API and callback documentation for 1.1.  It's very similar to the
  1.0 documentation, though, so there's nothing really exciting there.

<p>
  I also updated the "current release" note at the top of the main page.

<p>
  Several people have remarked how some of the plugins in the plugin registry
  state that they come with pyblosxom which is no longer the case.  We're
  working on putting together a separate contributed plugins pack release.
  Additionally, we're working on having the plugins available separately.
  This should be somewhat solved by February.  In the meantime, you can
  use the plugins you have with your existing PyBlosxom 1.0 installation 
  or download the PyBlosxom 1.0 tarball and get the plugins from there.

  Sorry for the inconvenience.
