  Development slowed down during the second half of 2010 because I was
  bogged down with other things.  I recognize how that totally sucks
  for the project.  I'm working on rectifying it now.
</p>
<p>
  Previously, we were using the SF bug tracker which sucked.  Since
  we did much with it, it's undergone a user interface overhaul and it's
  better, but it's still missing features this project needs.  So we
  stopped using it and I directed people to file bug reports by sending
  email to the pyblosxom-devel mailing list.
</p>
<p>
  In October of 2010, we discussed issue trackers.  Then I went on
  hiatus for a little over a month.  I've returned now and set up Roundup
  to host PyBlosxom issues and feature requests.  With help from Asheesh
  and the awesome folks at <a href="http://openhatch.org">OpenHatch</a>
  I added support for tracking milestones.  I've moved all open bugs
  and features from the SF bug tracker to the new bug tracker.
</p>
<p>
  You can find it at <a href="http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/bugs/">http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/bugs/</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I also got through the queue of merge requests from Dieter.  I
  really apologize for sitting on those for so long.  I really appreciate
  the work he did on them.
</p>
<p>
  I want to move ahead and get a PyBlosxom 1.5 rc3 out soon.  We're still
  fixing problems in plugins and working on getting PyBlosxom and the core
  plugins to a stable state--hence the need for ongoing release candidates
  rather than a final release.
</p>
<p>
  I want to thank Dieter for his prodding.  Also, Tim, Marius, Bill, Michael,
  Glennie, Sean, Sebastian, and Asheesh for their participation, efforts, 
  thoughts, and other positive energy things on #miro-hackers and the
  pyblosxom-devel list.  I'm looking forward to the rest of 2011, cleaning
  up the project and making it better for everyone.
