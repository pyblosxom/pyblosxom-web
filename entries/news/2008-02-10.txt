Site changes

<p>
  I re-worked the web-site so that it's checked into SVN along with
  the code and it's generated using the static renderer.  I did this
  for a couple of reasons:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>the web-site, except the wiki, is already static because we have 
      read-only permissions to the file system on SourceForge
  <li>putting it in SVN allows enterprising individuals to pull the whole
      thing down and work to make it look way better
  <li>it makes it easier for us to move the PyBlosxom project to some
      other system
  <li>it provides me a really solid testing ground for static rendering
</ol>
<p>
  If you bump into any issues, let me know.

  If you want to help overhaul the site so that it's way better, let
  me know.
