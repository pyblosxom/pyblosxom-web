  I've been fleshing out more of the PyBlosxom Manual to give Ted more
  material for a possible PyCon 2005 talk and also to fill in documentation
  gaps which will make a PyBlosxom 1.1 release easier for people.

<p>
  I encourage folks to skim the manual as it is thus far.  I'm still
  doing some minor organizational changes, but for the most part what's
  there will form the basis of the continuing manual saga.  If you have
  comments, complaints, interesting stories, or even additional manual
  material, toss it in the comments at the bottom of the relevant chapter.

  Rock on!
