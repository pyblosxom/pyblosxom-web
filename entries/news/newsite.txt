New site!

  Seems a little silly to have yet-another-pyblosxom site, but here's the
  thinking: we need a site that supports users, supports developers,
  has a manual, and centralizes flavours and plugins and stuff.  We're
  putting it on SourceForge with the rest of the project stuff.  We couldn't
  put it here until a week ago because their servers didn't have a version
  of Python installed that could run PyBlosxom.  But it does now, so
  everything's cool again.
</p>
<p>
  So far I have the following things working on this site:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>news entries
  <li>plugin registry
  <li>flavour registry
  <li>registry submissions
  <li>comments with secret number comment-spam prevention
  <li>rss for news and rss for registry
  <li>the start of a pyblosxom manual
</ul>
<p>
  Still to do:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>need a way to administrate comments (web-form?)
  <li>need to implement bloggar entry creation
  <li>continue working on pyblosxom manual
  <li>need to add comment preview (use Steven's version?)
  <li>need to add a link for archives
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, though, things are looking good.  Hopefully it shouldn't take too
  long to put the rest of the critical pieces together.
