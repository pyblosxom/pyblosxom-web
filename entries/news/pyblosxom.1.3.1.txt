<li><p>
   The "num_entries" property now affects the home page and category
   index pages.  It no longer affects archive index pages.
</p></li>
<li><p>
   Fixed the RSS 0.9.1 feed templates.  It has the correct link url
   and shows the entry bodies.  Thanks Norbert!
</p></li>
<li><p>
   The version string is correct.
</p></li>
<li><p>
   Added support for $body_escaped .
</p></li>
<li><p>
   Fixed the blog encoding on the RSS 2.0 feed so that it uses the
   value provided in the config.py $blog_encoding variable.
</p></li>
<li><p>
   Fixed the Atom 1.0 story flavour to use $body_escaped instead of
   &lt;![CDATA[ $body ]]&gt;
</p></li>
<li><p>
   Fixed a problem with static rendering where we'd render "/index.html"
   and "//index.html" if the user had entries in their root category.

   If you have plugins that use the logger functions in PyBlosxom 1.2,
   you need to update those plugins to use the new logger functions in
   PyBlosxom 1.3.  Read through the API for details.
</p></li>
<li><p>
   Moved documentation in ReadMeForPlugins.py over to the manual.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Also, I did a lot more work on the manual.  I folded in the documentation
  from ReadMeForPlugins, added a lot more "markers" for examples, added
  a static rendering sample configuration, and folded in some material
  from my blog.
