<p>
  We've done a ton of work over the last 3 and a half months.  One thing
  that I finally got around to was overhauling the web-site.  The new
  web-site is (I think) a lot better, more informative, and easier to
  use.
</p>
<p>
  Things that still need to be done:
</p>
<ol>
<li>update the plugin registry
<li>update the flavour registry
<li>compile the 1.5 documentation and push that to the site
</ol>
<p>
  There are still a series of outstanding tasks for PyBlosxom 1.5 that should
  get finished before we release 1.5 final.  We're working on them.  We
  could use your help!
</p>
<ul>
<li>check PyBlosxom 1.5 in git to see if it works with your blog and plugins
<li>run the unit tests
<li>edit and update documentation
<li>triage and fix bugs in the 1.5 milestone in the bug tracker
</ul>
<p>
  We just finished up a sprint week and we're eager to finish up 1.5 and
  get it out.  Hopefully, we'll get that done in the next week or two.
