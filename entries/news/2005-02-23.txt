Contributed plugins
#published 2005-02-23 13:15:18
<p>
  Up until PyBlosxom 1.1, we included a series of contributed plugins
  in the ./contrib directory.  These plugins were also listed in the
  registry.  When PyBlosxom 1.1 released without this contrib
  directory we created the problem where no one was able to get a hold
  of the contributed plugins without downloading a previous version of
  PyBlosxom.
</p>
<p>
  We're going to split up the release schedules for PyBlosxom and
  the contributed plugins pack.  This makes it easier for us to
  fix problems with plugins without having to do another release
  of PyBlosxom.
</p>
<p>
  We've released the first contributed plugins pack.  It's versioned
  along-side PyBlosxom.  So contrib.1.1 goes with PyBlosxom 1.1.

  You can find the contributed plugins pack
