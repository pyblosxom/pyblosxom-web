  Ben asked on the pyblosxom-users list whether there's anything other
  folks can do to help with this site.  The answer is yes, but it's nothing
  that's wildly exciting or glamorous.

  It would help if people could review the content in the manual.  There
  are a couple of ways you could send fixes, adjustments, and your thoughts
  on the content.  The first is to post a comment at the bottom of the
  chatper in question.  The second is to send an email to willhelm at
  users dot sourceforge dot net.  The third is to send an email to
  the pyblosxom-users mailing list.  Try to be as clear as you can
  about what you're trying to say.  Feel free to quote the sections
  you have issues with.  I'll incorproate any comments, thoughts, and
  additional content into the manual as I get them.  I'll create
  a contributors section on the content page with a list of contributors.

  Additionally, people are looking for flavours so if you have any to
  register, please do.

  I think that's about it.  We're still moving along at a steady clip.
  Assuming we can maintain this clip, we should have a solid PyBlosxom
  manual in a month or so--that's a huge step in making PyBlosxom more
  user-friendly for all of us.
