New site, new conventions, almost new version

  We're moving from SourceForge to Bluesock.  Bluesock is my own personal
  server where I'll have a lot more control over the site in terms of how
  it's built.  On SourceForge we're severely limited to static pages or
  the various applications that they install.  It's been a real pain in
  the ass.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, I've gone through the site and updated it to reflect our
  move from svn to git.
</p>
<p>
  On top of that, we're ditching the SourceForge bug tracker.  We don't
  have a bug tracker set up, though, so we're just going to wing it with
  the pyblosxom-devel mailing list.  If it becomes necessary, we'll set
  up a new bug tracker.
</p>
<p>
  PyBlosxom 1.5 is almost done.  A handful of things have been done since
  the release candidate a while back.  The documentation still needs another
  going over and parts of it need to be updated.
</p>
<p>
  Hopefully all that will happen soon.
