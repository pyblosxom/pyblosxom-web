PyBlosxom 1.5 development
#published 2009-06-05 17:59:22
<p>
  I'm finishing up work on PyBlosxom 1.5.  Generally speaking, 
  development is done.  Things left to do:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>documentation
  <li>testing
</ul>
<p>
  Lots of cleanup, some new features (exposed commandline for plugins,
  truncate callback, ...), simplified startup, and some other things.
</p>
<p>
  At this point, I think it's solid enough to use and I switched my
  blog to use it.  If you're so inclined, grab it from svn, read the 
  UPGRADE, CHANGELOG, and INSTALL documents and that should get you
  up and running.  Some plugins might need fixing, but it works on my
  blog and I used it to statically compile this site.
</p>
<p>
  If you have problems with PyBlosxom or with plugins, let us know 
  on <code>#miro-hackers</code> on <code>irc.freenode.net</code>
  or on the <code>pyblosxom-devel</code> mailing list.
