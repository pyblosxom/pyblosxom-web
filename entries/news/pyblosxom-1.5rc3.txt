PyBlosxom 1.5rc3 released
#published 2011-06-18 23:06:00
<p>
  We did 1.5 rc2 10 months ago.  Since then we've added a few new plugins,
  fixed a bunch of bugs, worked on making the documentation better, updated
  docstrings, and some other stuff.
</p>
<p>
  There are still a bunch of polish things that need to be done, so we're
  going to do another release candidate.
