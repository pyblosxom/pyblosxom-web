  This is the first time I've posted to the pyblosxom site, so bear with me.
</p>
<p>
  PyBlosxom took a small nap after 0.8.1 was released in order to let us 
  all catch up and figure out where we want to go and what is required 
  for a 1.0 release. About a month ago, developement started up again 
  with several focii:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>clean up the code-base
  <li>add support for locking (which may be taken out)
  <li>add support for logging
  <li>fix concurrancy issues
  <li>fix bugs (architectural and behavioral)
  <li>add support for unit testing
  <li>add support for static rendering 
</ul>
<p>
  There isn't a set timeline or a roadmap. For the most part, we're 
  working diligently and when we're ready for a release, we'll release 
  then. It's likely the next release will be 0.9.0 and it'll be in the 
  next few weeks since it's been a long time since the last release and 
  there have been some major architectural changes made.
</p>
<p>
  So that's the status as I understand it at this stage in the game.
