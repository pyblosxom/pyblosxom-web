New wiki for 2.0 planning

<p>
  I installed MediaWiki on SourceForge to manage and coordinate work on
  PyBlosxom 2.0.  We're slowly building specifications which specify what
  PyBlosxom does in 1.4, problems with that behavior and how it should
  be changed for 2.0.
</p>
<p>
  Discussion of the specifications should be kept in the discussion pages
  of the wiki and on IRC at <code>#pyblosxom</code> on 
  <code>irc.freenode.net</code>.
