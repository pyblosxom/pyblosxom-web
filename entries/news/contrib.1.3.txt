Contributed plugins 1.3 released
#published 2006-06-03 00:02:54
<p>
  This is the first release of the contributed plugins pack for PyBlosxom 1.3.
</p>
<p>
  Here's a list of changes between contributed plugins pack 1.2.2 and 1.3:
</p>
<p>
  <b>General</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added release dates to CHANGELOG.txt file.
<li>Fixed all logging to use the new functions in PyBlosxom 1.3.
</ul>

<p>
  <b>comments</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted the behavior so that comments are shown if "showcomments=yes"
   is in the querystring or if the pyblosxom request is for a specific
   blog entry (as opposed to a category with only one blog entry in it).
   In doing this, I moved the code from cb_pathinfo to cb_prepare.
   (Thanks to Matt Weber for the idea!)
<li>Removed the "showcomments=yes" from the comment-form html code.
<li>Fixes to allow the comments plugin work with Python 2.2.  (Thanks
   Nathan!)
<li>Adjusted the documentation text to make it clearer that the bit
   about what properties each entry needs to have applies only to
   developers.  Added __description__ and __url__ information.
<li>Fixed issues with rendering.  Also removed the "if this is rss,
   then don't do stuff".
<li>Fixed an issue where if the config.py file doesn't have blog_encoding
   set, the comments plugin would die.
<li>Fixed a security problem where the url and author fields were not
   getting sanitized.  (Thanks Tung Wai Yip!)
<li>Unfixed the url not getting sanitized--we already remove html from
   it and sanitize unnecessarily adds an &lt;a href...&gt; &lt;/a&gt; to it.
<li>Re-added the logging code that the comments plugin uses when things
   go sour.
<li>Added SMTP-sanitization to the email field.  (Thanks David!)
<li>Changed the comment reject callback so that rejection plugins can
   return 0 (the comment is fine), 1 (the comment is rejected) or
   a tuple of 1 and the error message as a string.<br /><br />

   For example:<br />
   <ul>
      <li>return 0
      <li>return 1
      <li>return (1, "This comment contains a blacklisted address.")
   </ul>

   (Thanks Steven!)
<li>Changed the format of the body of the email that the comments plugin
   sends the blog owner to be more informational and readable.
   (Thanks Alec!)
</ul>

<p>
<b>pycategories</b>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a cosmetic issue where an extra / was getting added to the
   root url
<li>Fixed a problem where the finish template was incorrectly pulling
   from the category_finish config property.  (Thanks Rob!)
<li>Fixed a problem where the totals weren't being counted correctly.
   (Thanks Rob!)
<li>Added "_urlencoded" versions of the category variables.  (Thanks
   Petteri!)
</ul>

<p>
<b>rst entryparser</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added two configurable options to the rst entryparser.  The first
   sets the starting level for rendered heading elements.  The second
   enables and disables the promotion of a lone top-level section title
   to the document title.  (Thanks Jan-Wijbrand!)
<li>Fixed the rst entryparser to handle metadata.  (Thanks to spanezz!)
</ul>

<p>
<b>xmlrpc_metaweblog</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed _getCategories so that it returns a list of dicts rather
   than a list of strings.  This conforms to the metaWeblogApi
   (http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi) and fixes the getCategories
   request.  (Thanks Rob!)
</ul>
