  There have been lots of changes in the last few months.  We're
  finishing up PyBlosxom 1.5 and we're moving the project to different
  infrastructure.  Let me cover these one at a time.
</p>
<p>
  We did a PyBlosxom 1.5 rc1 release a couple of months ago.  Since
  then, we've been hanging out on <code>#pyblosxom</code> on Freenode
  and fielding questions.  I think it's going really well for
  everyone.  As people bring up issues, we're fixing them or putting
  them on the TODO list to get fixed.  Most of the problems revolve
  around plugin support or plugin bugs.
</p>
<p>
  We've been working on updating plugins in the contributed plugins
  pack.  We're also getting rid of the contributed plugins pack and
  going back to what we used to do several versions ago where we ship
  plugins with the PyBlosxom tarball.  Plugins that are used by many
  users and are well supported will be located in
  the <code>plugins/</code> directory of the tarball.  We have a unit
  test system set up and we're adding tests for these plugins.  We'll
  be making an effort going forward to update plugins as we update
  PyBlosxom core and everything should be shiny happy.
</p>
<p>
  We're planning to rework the plugin registry on the site to provide
  an index of all the plugins out there--both those in the tarball and
  those maintained by other people.  Work on this hasn't started,
  yet.  I think this is a post PyBlosxom 1.5 project.
</p>
<p>
  There are a handful of plugins that I want to update, add tests for,
  and move to the <code>plugins/</code> directory to ship with the
  tarball.  Once that happens, we'll release a 1.5 final.
</p>
<p>
  In regards to the infrastructure, we're switching to git.  Sebastian
  very kindly converted our svn repository into three git repositories
  that are now at
  <a href="http://gitorious.org/pyblosxom/">http://gitorious.org/pyblosxom/</a>.
  This will make development a lot easier going forward.
</p>
<p>
  We're also scheming to rework the website so it's a better project
  website, has a better registry for plugins and flavours, and makes
  it easier for us to collaborate on PyBlosxom development.
</p>
<p>
  That's where we're at.  If you want to contribute and/or hang out,
  we're on <code>#pyblosxom</code> on Freenode and the PyBlosxom
  develop mailing list.
