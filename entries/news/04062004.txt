  after 0.9 was released. If you have 0.9 installed and it's working fine, 
  then don't worry about upgrading.

<ul>
  <li>Fixed MANIFEST.in file to include comments flavour files and README
  <li>Fixed make_logger to work better for Python 2.2 and earlier versions
  <li>Fixed the entryshelve caching plugin
  <li>Update pytextile entryparser to 2.0
  <li>Fixed verify_installation code to work when load_plugins is not set
  <li>Fixed a bug with pycategories plugin 
</ul>
<p>
  That's it!
