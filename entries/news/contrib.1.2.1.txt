Contributed plugins 1.2.1 released
#published 2005-05-07 19:50:00
<p>
  This is the second release of the contributed plugins pack for PyBlosxom 1.2.
  In terms of functionality, there were a bunch of fixes to the comments and
  trackbacks components and I overhauled pycategories. Beyond that, there were a
  lot of license changes (or in most cases license applications) and some
  documentation changes. In general, this release is a huge milestone for
  sorting out the big mess that was the contributed plugins.

<p>
  Bravo to Wari, Ted, Steven, Blake, Bill, and everyone else that was involved
  in pulling this together.
