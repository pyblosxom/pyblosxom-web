PyBlosxom 1.4 released
#published 2007-07-02 15:20:10
<p>
  Pertinent to users:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Added a pyblcmd command line program for PyBlosxom command line
   things.  This now handles static rendering, rendering a single
   url to stdout, testing your blog setup, ...</li>

<li>The Atom story template now has a $default_flavour bit in the link.
   Bug 1667937.  (Thanks Michael!)</li>

<li>PyBlosxom is now locale aware in respects to dates, months, days of the
   week and such.  Users should set the locale config property to a
   valid locale if they don't want English.</li>

<li>Added a ``blog_icbm`` config variable for use in the ICBM meta tag.  See
   config_variables.txt for more information.</li>

<li>Changed the ``num_entries`` property in config.py from 40 to a much more
   conservative 5.  Also changed the default value from 0 to 5 if you
   happened not to set ``num_entries`` at all.

   (Thanks Jon!)</li>

<li>Changed the self link in the atom feed to be of type
   application/atom+xml.

   (Thanks Brian!)</li>

<li>Added DOCUMENT_ROOT to the python path per Martin's suggestion.

   (Thanks Martin!)</li>

<li>Translated all documentation from Docbook to reST.  reST documentation
   is easier to read in "source-form" and a lot easier to convert to HTML
   and other formats using the Python docutils tools.  (Thanks John!)</li>

<li>Added support for Paste and brought the WSGI support into the
   codebase.  (Thanks Steven and Yury!)</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Pertinent to developers:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Lots of code clean-up, documentation, test-code, and some refactoring.</li>

<li>cb_filestat will only do an os.stat if no plugin handles the filestat.
   Previously, cb_filestat did an os.stat and ran through all the
   plugins allowing them to over-ride it.</li>

<li>Added some testing framework pieces.  This requires nose.  To run
   the tests, do::
<pre>
      nosetests --verbose --include unit
      nosetests --verbose --include functional
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Many thanks to all the people who've helped out over the last 17 months or
so and the patience of our users.
