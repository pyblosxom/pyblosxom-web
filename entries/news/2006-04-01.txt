Moved from CVS to Subversion

<p>
  As of this point, we've successfully moved all our code from
  a CVS repository to a Subversion repository.  I went through
  the web-site and updated it to reflect the move to Subversion.
  I'm in the process of re-organizing some things in the 
  repository to make them easier to deal with.
