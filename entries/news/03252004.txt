<p>
  This is my quick plug for 
  <a href="http://www.planetpyblosxom.org/">PlanetPyblosxom</a>.  The site 
  will focus on Pyblosxom users and using Pyblosxom. I'm slowing moving all 
  my material from my blog to the PlanetPyblosxom blog. We're also moving 
  the plugin registry there as well.

<p>
  Please check out the site and if you have any comments, let me know at 
  willg at bluesock dot org.
</p>
<p>
  Rock on!
