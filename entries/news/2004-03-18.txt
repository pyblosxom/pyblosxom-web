#published 2004-03-18 19:20:00
<p>
  After several months of hard work by all the developers and members of 
  the community, we've released the next version of Pyblosxom.
</p>
<p>
  0.9 has the following changes in it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added a logger and locking code
  <li>Overhauled the xmlrpc system
  <li>Added the verify_installation code
  <li>Added handle callback
  <li>Added Atom 0.3 flavour
  <li>Overhaul of code base to fix concurrancy issues
  <li>Added support for Metaweblog API
  <li>Bug fixes, security fixes, and optimizations 
</ul>
<p>
  It's highly encouraged that all people upgrade since plugins written for 
  0.9 will not work in previous versions of Pyblosxom.
