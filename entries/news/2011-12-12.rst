It's been a while since the last status update and a lot has happened
since then:

* renamed the project from PyBlosxom to Pyblosxom
* folded core plugins into the Pyblosxom core
* moved the pyblosxom repository from gitorious to github
* added new plugins, bug fixes, more tests, fixed documentation, ...

We're pretty close to a 1.5 final release.  This release has been a long time
coming and it'll be good to get it out.  I'm hoping it'll happen in the next
week.
