PyBlosxom 1.0 RC1 released!

<p>
  I'm releasing pyblosxom 1.0 RC1 right now. I overhauled the callback 
  documentation in the ReadMeForPlugins file and read through other 
  documentation and I think we're good enough for a 1.0 release now.
</p>
<p>
  The RC1 is <a href="http://bluesock.org/~willg/dev/pyblosxom/pyblosxom-1.0-RC1.tar.gz">here</a> (bluesock.org)
</p>
<p>
  Feel free to download it and test it out--it's very much like alpha1 with 
  a few differences:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>I threw in a logdir property into config.py and adjusted plugins 
      that use logfiles to use it.
  <li>Documentation fixes. 
</ul>
<p>
  That's about it, I think.
</p>
<p>
  In the tar.gz file is an INSTALL file which details installing PyBlosxom. 
  There is also a README which talks about differences between 0.9 and 1.0 
  (which will help you upgrade an existing PyBlosxom installation).
</p>
<p>
  Let me know what you think. I plan on doing a 1.0 release in the next 
  few days. Probably Thursday.
