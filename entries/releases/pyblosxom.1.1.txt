PyBlosxom 1.1 released
#published 2005-01-06 09:48:21
<p>
  It's been a long time coming, but it's here now.  Changes since
  the last release:
</p>
<p>
  <b>Pertinent to users:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>We no longer include contributed plugins and flavours with the
    release.  To find plugins and flavours, use the PyBlosxom registry.

<li>We changed how num_entries is handled internally.  If num_entries
    is set to 0, the blosxom default file handler will display all
    the entries.  If num_entries is set to a positive number, then
    the blosxom default file handler will display at most that many
    entries.
</ol>
<p>
  <b>Pertinent to developers and plugin developers:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Plugins that implement cb_filelist are now in charge of adjusting
    the number of entries to be displayed based on the num_entries
    configuration variable.  This is no longer done in the renderer.

<li>We added HTTP_COOKIE to the list of things that get added to the http
    dict in the Request object.
</ol>
<p>
  I know there will be some issues with us not packaging contributed
  plugins with the code.  We're planning to package contributed plugins
  in a separate release with its own release cycle.
</p>

  If you have problems, check out the PyBlosxom Manual and if that doesn't
  help, send us questions on the pyblosxom-users mailing list.
