Contributed plugins 1.1.1 released
#published 2005-03-27 17:50:13
<p>
  This is a followup for the contrib 1.1 release.  These plugins 
  should work with PyBlosxom 1.1.
</p>
<p>
  Use these plugins at your own risk.  Each plugin should have 
  documentation at the top of the plugin file.  Read that for installation 
  instructions.

<p>
  The only difference between 1.1 and 1.1.1 is that I removed the
  bad block of code in the comments plugin.  If you are using PyBlosxom
  1.1 and either have the comments plugin working fine or you're not
  using it at all, then don't worry about this release.
