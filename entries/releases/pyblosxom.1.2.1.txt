PyBlosxom 1.2.1 released
#published 2005-06-01 23:45:10
<p>
  This is a minor bugfix for PyBlosxom 1.2.  If you use the conditionalhttp 
  plugin, you'll want to upgrade.  Otherwise, it's not crucial.
</p>
<p>
  Changes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem where the blosxom renderer never c hecked to see if
  it had already rendered the page.  This affects the conditionalhttp
  plugin, but not much else.
<li>Removed an extra filestat.
<li>Added a setTimeLazy method to the FileEntry class.
</ul>
<p>
  If you have any problems, check out the PyBlosxom Manual and if that
  doesn't help, send us questions on the pyblosxom-users mailing list.
