#published 2010-01-29 16:18:00
<p>
  It's been two years since the last release.  Since then the world has turned,
  tools have improved (thank you Sphinx!), and PyBlosxom has undergone a lot
  of changes.  The list of changes is really long.  As such, this is a release
  candidate to get some more testing.
