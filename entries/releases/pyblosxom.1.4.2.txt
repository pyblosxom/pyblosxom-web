PyBlosxom 1.4.2 released
#published 2007-08-29 18:51:28
<p>
  PyBlosxom 1.4.1 still had issues with WSGI, Paste and running on Python 2.5.  This
  release fixes those issues, fixes some issues with running on Windows, and has
  better documentation for installation.
</p>
<p>
  If you're having problems getting 1.4.1 running on Windows or Python 2.5/WSGI/Paste,
  I highly recommend you upgrade to 1.4.2.
