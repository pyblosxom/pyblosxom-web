PyBlosxom 1.5rc2 released
#published 2010-08-03 10:00:00
<p>
  It's been about 6 months since 1.5 rc1.  Since then we've been updating
  plugins, added some new plugins, adding tests, fixed documentation, 
  added a sortlist callback, updated docstrings, switched from subversion
  to git, moved from SourceForge to Bluesock, and some other stuff.
</p>
<p>
  Doing another release candidate because there's still a lot of work to
  do updating plugins, adding tests, and fixing documentation.
