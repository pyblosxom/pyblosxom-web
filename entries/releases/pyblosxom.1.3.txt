<li><p>
   We added a "blog_rights" property.  This holds a textual description
   of the rights you give to others who read your blog.  Leaving this
   blank or not filling it in will affect the RSS 2.0 and ATOM 1.0
   feeds.
</p></li>
<li><p>
   If you set "flavourdir" in your config.py file, you have to put
   your flavour files in that directory tree.  If you don't set
   "flavourdir", then PyBlosxom expects to find your flavour files
   in your "datadir".
</p><p>
   The flavour overhaul is backwards compatible with previous PyBlosxom
   versions.  So if you want to upgrade your blog, but don't want to
   move your flavour files to a new directory, DON'T set your "flavourdir"
   property.
</p></li>
<li><p>
   Moved the content that was in README to CHANGELOG.
</p></li>
<li><p>
   You can now organize the directory hierarchy of your blog by date.
   For example, you could create a category for each year and put
   posts for that year in that year (2003, 2004, 2005, ...).  Previously
   URLs requesting "2003", "2004", ... would get parsed as dates and
   would pull blog entries by mtime and not by category.
</p></li>
<li><p>
   Logging works now.  The following configuration properties are
   useful for determining whether events in PyBlosxom are logged and
   what will get logged:
</p>
<ul>
<li>"log_file" - the file that PyBlosxom events will be logged to--the
                web-server MUST be able to write to this file.</li>
<li>"log_level" - the level of events to write to the log.  options are
                 "critical", "error", "warning", "info", and "debug"</li>
<li>"log_filter" - the list of channels that should have messages logged.
                  if you set the log_filter and omit "root", then app-level
                  messages are not logged.</li>
</ul>
<p>
   It's likely you'll want to set log_file and log_level and that's it.
   Omit log_file and logging will fall back to stderr which usually gets
   logged to your web-server's error log.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Nothing that I know of.  Everything should work pretty much the same.
</p>
<p>
Also, I've done a lot of work on the manual which can be found
<a href="http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/1.3/manual/index.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Many thanks to all the people who've helped out over the last 8 months or
so.
