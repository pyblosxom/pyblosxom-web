PyBlosxom 1.4.1 released
#published 2007-07-27 00:36:09
<p>
  PyBlosxom 1.4 had some issues with WSGI, Paste and running on Python 2.5.  This 
  release fixes those issues, has a minor optimization in Walk (Ryan removed a silly 
  call to os.listdir), and has some updated documentation regarding installing with 
  Paste.
</p>
<p>
  If you're running 1.4, I highly recommend you upgrade to 1.4.1.
