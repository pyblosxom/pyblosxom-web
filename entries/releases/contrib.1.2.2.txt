#published 2005-06-21 14:35:12
<p>
  This is the third release of the contributed plugins pack for PyBlosxom 1.2.
</p>
<p>
  Here's the list of changes between contributed pack 1.2.1 and 1.2.2:
</p>
<b>General</b>
<ul>
<li>New CHANGELOG.txt file which describes the changes between this version
   and the last as well as compatability and behavior issues.

<li>New README.txt file which describes what's in the contributed plugins
   pack, where you can find it, and various other things about the contributed
   plugins pack.
</ul>

<b>genericwiki</b>
<ul>
<li>Matej updated genericwiki so that it works as an entryparser as well as
   a preformatter.  Will fixed up the documentation.  genericwiki was moved
   from the preformatter directory to the entryparser directory.  Thanks Matej!
</ul>

<b>pycategories</b>
<ul>
<li>Now has two new properites "category_start" which gets printed once before 
   printing the category list and "category_finish" which gets printed once 
   after printing the category list.  Additionally, the default values for 
   "category_begin" and "category_end" were fixed.  This makes the default 
   output for pycategories (x)html compliant.  Thanks Joseph!
</ul>

<b>comments</b>
<ul>
<li>comments no longer shows comments by default!  In order to view comments
   for a given entry, you must append "showcomments=yes" to the querystring.
   THIS IS NOT A BACKWARDS-COMPATIBLE CHANGE!  Thanks David!

<li>comments no longer has documentation for the unused comments-rejected-words
   property.

<li>comments no longer requires the email field.

<li>all the flavour templates for the comments plugin have been updated.

<li>We cleaned up the comment error messages so they're useful to the user.
   Thanks Nathaniel!
</ul>

<b>w3cdate</b>
<ul>
<li>w3cdate plugin now provides $w3cdate in head and foot templates.  It no
   longer requires PyXML.  Thanks to Steven and Matej!
</ul>
<p>
  Thanks to Steven, David, Joseph, Matej, and Nathaniel for their contributions and
  help.
