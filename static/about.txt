PyBlosxom
<p>
  PyBlosxom is a lightweight file-based weblog system.  The project started
  as a Python clone of <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blosxom</a> but 
  has since evolved into a beast of its own.  PyBlosxom focuses on three
  things: simplicity, extensibility, and community.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <p>
    <b>simplicity</b> - PyBlosxom uses the file system for all its data storage.
    Because of this you can use whatever existing editor, scripts and tools
    you want to create, update and manipulate entries and other blog data.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    <b>extensibility</b> - PyBlosxom has a plugin framework allowing you to build
    plugins in Python to augment and change PyBlosxom's default behavior.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    <b>community</b> - There are hundreds of PyBlosxom users out there all of
    whom have different needs.  PyBlosxom is used on a variety of operating
    systems in a variety of environments.  The pyblosxom users list shares
    their experiences, plugins, and expertise.  The pyblosxom devel list
    shares their ideas for changes, patches and plugins.
  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
  PyBlosxom can run in CGI environments, under <a href="http://pythonpaste.org/">Paste</a>,
  and as a <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/">WSGI</a> application.
</p>
<p>
  As such, PyBlosxom is a pretty straight-forward system that allows you to do 
  the things you need to do without building everything from scratch.
