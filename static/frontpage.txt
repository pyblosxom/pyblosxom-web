Welcome to PyBlosxom!
<h2>What is PyBlosxom?</h2>

<p><b>PyBlosxom is:</b></p>

<ul>
<li><b>File-Based:</b> In PyBlosxom everything is a text file.
Entries are files, configuration is a file, plugins are files, etc...
This makes PyBlosxom easily extensible in whatever environment you
choose to work in and instantly compatable with command line scripting.
</li>

<li><b>Extensible:</b> Pyblosxom has a plugin framework which allows you
to customize and extend PyBlosxom in almost every way. </li>

<li><b>Standards-compliant:</b> PyBlosxom supports RSS 2.0 and Atom syndication feeds.</li>

<li><b>Customizeable:</b> PyBlosxom has a simple templating engine to make it easy to design
your own themes with a minimum of development knowlage.</li>

<li><b>Community-oriented:</b> We pride ourselves in being a nice, open and friendly community.
PyBlosxom has hundreds of active users, each of them running PyBlosxom in different ways and
on different operating systems. As a result, there is usually someone on the IRC channel or
mailing lists who has encountered your problem before and who would be willing to lend a
hand. If you don't get a satisfactory response, take that as motivation to figure it out
and help add to our extensive documentation!</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Pyblosxom allows you to use your favorite editor, toolset and
  workflow to maintain your blog without forcing you to build it all
  from scratch.
