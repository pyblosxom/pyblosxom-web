Where to get help for problems with plugins
#nocomments yes
<p>
  If you use a plugin you found in the registry and have problems, there
  are a couple of things you can do:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>contact the author--hopefully they have their email address in the
      docstring of the plugin (i.e. open the plugin .py file, skim through
      it for the email address of the author)
  <li>leave a comment here
  <li>send an email to the
      <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/pyblosxom-users">PyBlosxom-users mailing list</a>
</ul>
