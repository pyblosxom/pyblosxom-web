Submitting items to the registry
<p>
  SourceForge has our file system as read-only which prevents us from
  handling registry submissions automatically.  Sorry about that.
</p>
<h2>Submitting a new plugin</h2>
<p>
  Submit a plugin to the registry by emailing <font color="#0000ff">willhelm
  at users dot sourceforge dot net</font> the following information:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>your name as it should appear on the site
  <li>name of your plugin
  <li>category you think it should go in
  <li>a description of your plugin and any notes users should know about
  <li>the url for the page about your plugin
  <li>the url to download your plugin
</ul>
<p>
  Allow me a few days to turn around the request--usually I (Will) am pretty 
  quick about it unless my car has a flat tire or I'm somewhere far away.
  If I have any problems, I'll email you back.
</p>

<h2>Submitting a new flavour</h2>
<p>
  Submit a new flavour to the flavour registry by emailing <font color="#0000ff">willhelm

  <li>a description of the flavour including any special instructions
  <li>the url of a .png screenshot of your flavour in action

<h2>Updating a plugin</h2>
