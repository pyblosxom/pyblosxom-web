<a name="summary"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>
  This page covers how to contribute to PyBlosxom development, what
  our coding conventions (or should be), our mission, lists a
  non-comprehensive list of contributors, and then ends with a short
  blurb that will eventually be replaced with the processes we use to
  do things.
</p>
<p>
  If you plan on contributing to PyBlosxom, please read this guide in
  its entirety.
</p>
<p>
  Having said that, this guide is a draft and can change at any
  time--we update it as necessary.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Tie your changes to an issue in the issue tracker!</b>
</p>
<p>
  It vastly simplifies the work if your work is tied to an issue
  in the tracker.  If there isn't an issue, yet, for the work you
  want to do, please create one.  If there is an issue, then assign
  it to yourself, do the work, and comment on that issue when you're
  done.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Use bugfix branches!</b>
</p>
<p>
  It's important to use a workflow that puts changes related to a
  single bug/feature in a separate branch.  We call this a bugfix
  branch.  You can name it something like <code>issue_101</code>.
  Generally, short branch names are easier to use.
</p>
<p>
  If you're working on two different features, you should have a
  different branch for each of them.  This greatly simplifies things
  when I accept patches, reject patches, make changes, etc in the
  master branch.  This way, when you fetch, your master branch isn't
  wildly diverged from the PyBlosxom master branch which requires
  some tinkering to get aligned again.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Properly document your changes!</b>
</p>
<p>
  Three things to do to make it easier for us to use your hard
  work!:
</p>
<ol>
<li>describe the problem you're solving with your patch
<li>describe how your patch solves the problem
<li>include unit tests
</ol>

<p>
  <b>How to create a bugfix branch</b>
</p>
<p>
  Here's how to clone the repository and create a bugfix branch:
</p>
<ol>
<li>clone the repository:<br/>
<pre>
$ git clone git://gitorious.org/pyblosxom/pyblosxom.git
</pre>
<li>set the <tt>user.name</tt> and <tt>user.email</tt> config bits:<br/>
<pre>
$ git config user.name "your name"
$ git config user.email "your@email.address"
</pre>
<li>create a bug/feature focused branch for the change you want to make
<pre>
$ git fetch --all
$ git checkout -b BRANCHNAME origin/master
</pre>
<li>make the changes you want to make in that bug/feature focused branch
  and commit them
<li>when you're done, send us the changes
</ol>

<p>
  <b>How to send us your changes</b>
</p>
<p>
  There are a few ways to send us your changes:
</p>
<ol>

<li>do:
<pre>
$ git format-patch -o patches origin/master
</pre>
  tar up the directory and attach it to the issue it relates to, OR

<li>push your changes to a publicly available repository and add
  a comment to the issue with the url of your repository, the branch
  the changes are in, and what you did, OR

<li>push your changes to a clone on gitorious and request a merge
  between PyBlosxom master and your bugfix branch
</ol>

<p>
  <b>If you have questions</b>

<a name="coding"><h2>Coding Style Guide</h2></a>
<p>
  Follow <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP-8</a>.
</p>


<a name="tests"><h2>Tests</h2></a>
<p>
  Tests go in the <tt>Pyblosxom/tests/</tt> directory.  From PyBlosxom
  1.4 on, write tests for new functionality.
</p>
<p>
  Tests are written using the <tt>unittest</tt> module.

<p>
  The PyBlosxom manual is in the <code>docs/</code> directory.
  Documentation is
  in <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">restructured
