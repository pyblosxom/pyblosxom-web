<a name="summary"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>
  This page covers how to contribute to PyBlosxom development, what
  our coding conventions (or should be), our mission, lists a
  non-comprehensive list of contributors, and then ends with a short
  blurb that will eventually be replaced with the processes we use to
  do things.
</p>
<p>
  If you plan on contributing to PyBlosxom, please read this guide in
  its entirety.
</p>
<p>
  Having said that, this guide is a draft and can change at any
  time--we update it as necessary.
</p>


<a name="patch"><h2>How to send us a patch</h2></a>
<p>
  Here's one way to send us a patch:
</p>
<ol>
<li>clone the repository:<br/>
<pre>
$ git clone git://gitorious.org/pyblosxom/pyblosxom.git
</pre>
<li>set the <tt>user.name</tt> and <tt>user.email</tt> config bits:<br/>
<pre>
$ git config user.name "your name"
$ git config user.email "your@email.address"
</pre>
<li>make the changes you want to make and commit them to your clone
  with useful comments
<li>when you're done, create patches:<br/>
<pre>
$ git format-patch -o patches origin/master
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
  After that we're prefer you either attach your patches to an
  existing issue in the issue tracker, create a new issue and attach
  the patches to that, or send your patches to the pyblosxom-devel
  list.  The former two methods are best since it's less likely your
  patches will get lost.  The latter method is there for people who
  really don't want to use our issue tracker.
</p>
<p>
  Three things to do to make it easier for us to use your hard
  work!:
</p>
<ol>
<li>describe the problem you're solving with your patch
<li>describe how your patch solves the problem
<li>include unit tests
</ol>
<p>
  If you have questions, ask us on the pyblosxom-devel mailing list.
