<a name="summary"><h2>Summary</h2></a>
<p>
  This page covers how to contribute to PyBlosxom development, what our 
  coding conventions (or should be), our mission, lists a non-comprehensive
  list of contributors, and then ends with a short blurb that will eventually
  be replaced with the processes we use to do things.
</p>
<p>
  If you plan on contributing to PyBlosxom, please read this guide in its 
  entirety.
</p>
<p>
  Having said that, this guide is a draft and can change at any time--we 
  update it as necessary.
</p>

<a name="howtocontribute"><h2>How to contribute</h2></a>
<p>
  Some folks want to become part of the development.  Other folks just want
  to send us a patch that fixes something that bugged them.  We appreciate
  both groups of folks and ...  well, we'll take whatever we can get.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to send us a patch, send it to the pyblosxom-devel mailing
  list.  Make sure it's clear what the patch is fixing and why you fixed
  it that way.  Please note any issues there might be and how much testing
  it went through.  Details on the pyblosxom-devel mailing list are on
  the <a href="/blog/static/contact">contact page</a>.
</p>
<p>
  All contributions are appreciated even if they aren't directly used.
  Sometimes the patch will start a conversation that might end up in a
  different fix.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to become a PyBlosxom developer we ask that you join the
  pyblosxom-devel mailing list, tell us your intentions and what your
  mission is, and then the conversation will go from there.
</p>
<p>
  If you want to contribute but have no coding skills--that's ok!  There's
  all kinds of other ways people can contribute: fixing/editing/adding
  documentation, finding bugs, contributing tutorials, helping folks who
  are new to PyBlosxom come up to speed, ...
</p>
<p>
  PyBlosxom has a sophisticated callback framework allowing for plugins to
  modify existing PyBlosxom behavior.  Many problems can be solved by
  writing a plugin rather than adding more code to the PyBlosxom core.
</p>

<a name="contributors"><h2>Contributors</h2></a>
<p>
  Note from Will: I don't have a list of contributors.  If you've contributed
  to PyBlosxom but don't see your name here (or if you want your name modified
  or even removed), let us know on the pyblosxom-devel mailing list.
</p>
<p>
  This list is in no particular order:
</p>
<p>
  Wari, Blake, Ted, Will, Bill, Robert, LionKimbro, Limdou, Steven, David,
  and Matej.
</p>

<a name="svn"><h2>Subversion</h2></a>
<p>
  Our code is in a Subversion repository on SourceForge.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://pyblosxom.svn.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.cgi/pyblosxom/">Browse
  Subversion Repository</a> through your web-browser.
</p>
<p>
  For anonymous read-only access to PyBlosxom trunk code do:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>svn co https://pyblosxom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pyblosxom/trunk/pyblosxom/ pyblosxom</code>
</ol>
<p>
  For anonymous read-only access to PyBlosxom contributed plugins code do:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>svn co https://pyblosxom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pyblosxom/trunk/contrib/ contrib</code>
</ol>
<p>
  If you are a registered PyBlosxom developer with Subversion access, you can check out
  the code using the above methods.  When you go to commit things, use the form:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>svn commit --username <i>your-username</i> <i>files...</i></code>
</ol>
<p>
  <b>Notes about checkin comments:</b> PLEASE provide comprehensive checkin comments
  that describe what you did, why you did it, any known ramifications of what you did
  to users/developers, related bug numbers, and any other notes.  We use the checkin 
  comments to figure out the CHANGELOG for releases and also to tell users what changes 
  they have to make to their installation when they upgrade.
</p>

<a name="coding"><h2>Coding Style Guide</h2></a>
<p>
  Follow <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP-8</a>.
</p>

<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>
  Tests go in the <code>Pyblosxom/tests/</code> directory.  From PyBlosxom 
  1.4 on, write tests for new functionality.
</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
  The PyBlosxom manual is in the <code>docs/</code> directory.  Documentation
  is in <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">restructured text</a>
  format.
</p>

<a name="release"><h2>Release Instructions</h2></a>
<p>
  First, the checklist:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>make sure everything is checked in and there are no outstanding issues
  <li>make sure MANIFEST.in is correct
  <li>build the tar ball:
<pre>
python setup.py sdist
</pre>
  <li>run a test install
  <li>run tests:
<pre>
python setup.py test
python plugins/testrunner.py
</pre>
  <li>make sure the documentation builds correctly:
<pre>
cd docs
make html
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
  Now the instructions:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>change VERSION in pyblosxom/Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py to something like
      this: <code>"1.4"</code>
  <li>change VERSION_DATE in pyblosxom/Pyblosxom/pyblosxom.py to something
      like: <code>VERSION + " 7/2/2007" (m/d/yyyy)</code>
  <li>check in all changes
  <li>tag the release
<pre>
svn cp https://pyblosxom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pyblosxom/branches/PYBLOSXOM_1_4 \
       https://pyblosxom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pyblosxom/tags/pyblosxom_1.4.3/
</pre>
  <li>run:
<pre>
python setup.py sdist
</pre>
  <li>use ReleaseForge to create the new release with the resulting .tar.gz
  <ol>
    <li>launch releaseforge
    <li>log in
    <li>select "pyblosxom" from the projects list
    <li>select "pyblosxom" from the packages list
