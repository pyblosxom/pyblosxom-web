<h2>For problems with a specific plugin</h2>
<p>
  Contact the author of the plugin using the contact information that author
  provided in the plugin docstring or in the README that accompanied the
  plugin.  If that proves unsuccessful, you can try asking the pyblosxom-devel
  mailing list, but we make no warranties for supporting other peoples' plugins
  and it is possible that we will be no help at all.
