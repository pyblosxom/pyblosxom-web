  This web-site is statically compiled with PyBlosxom and these plugins:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/blog/registry/archives/wbgarchives">wbgarchives</a></b> -
      Creates the archive-by-year links in the navigation bar and builds the 
      pages those links link to.
  <li><b><a href="http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/blog/registry/files/pystaticfile">pystaticfile</a></b> - 
      Allows for "static content" which isn't entry-related.  The PyBlosxom 
      manual and the rest of the non-news content are all "static" pages.  
      Note, this has nothing to do with static rendering.
  <li><b><a href="http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/blog/registry/general/registry">registry</a></b> - 
      Handles the plugin and flavour registry.
  <li><b><a href="http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/blog/registry/include/pyinclude">pyinclude</a></b> -
      Allows us to do server-side-include-like things to centralize information
      between multiple templates.
  <li><b><a href="http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/blog/registry/syndication/rss2renderer">rss2renderer</a></b> -
      Generates the RSS2 feeds.
</ul>
