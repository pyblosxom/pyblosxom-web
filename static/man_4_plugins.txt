<h2>1. What Are Plugins</h2>
<p>
  PyBlosxom allows you to extend its base functionality using drop-in 
  plugins.  These plugins can extend functionality by providing addition 
  template variables for things like archive lists, calendars, and such. 
  PyBlosxom uses CallbackChains to call functions in the plugins so that 
  they can do their thing.
</p>

<h2>2. Setting PyBloxsom up to Use Plugins</h2>
<p>
  There are two properties in your <code>config.py</code> file that 
  affect the behavior for loading plugins.
</p>
<p>
  The first one is the <code>plugin_dirs</code> property which is 
  a list of strings specifying all the directories you might have plugins.
  For example:
</p>
<pre>
py["plugin_dirs"] = ["/home/will/pybloxsom/plugins"]
</pre>
<p>
  This will cause PyBlosxom to look in this specific directory for
  plugins.
</p>
<p>
  The other property is the <code>load_plugins</code> property.  If you
  don't have this set at all, PyBlosxom will load all plugins it finds
  in the plugin directories you've specified and load them.  It will
  look in each directory in order as you've specified.  It will load
  the plugins in each directory in alphabetical order by filename.
</p>
<p>
  The other way to load plugins is by specifying the plugins explicitly
  by setting the <code>load_plugins</code> property.  PyBlosxom will load 
  only the plugins you've specified and will load them in the order you've 
  specified.  The <code>load_plugins</code> property takes a list of strings.
  For example:
</p>
<pre>
py["load_plugins"] = ["calendar", "category", "booklist"]
</pre>
<p>
  This will load the plugins whose filenames are "calendar.py", "category.py",
  and "booklist.py".  It will load them in that order and will only load
  those plugins even if you have other plugins in your plugin directories.
</p>

<h2>3. Finding Plugins</h2>
<p>
  You can find plugins in the plugin registry at 
  http://pyblosxom.sourceforge.net/ .
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, some people write plugins, but never register with the 
  plugin registry.  Sometimes this is because the author doesn't feel 
  the plugin is finished for public consumption.  Even so, it might meet 
  your needs.  The best way to find these plugins is to ask on the 
  pyblosxom-users mailing list for a plugin that has the functionality
  you desire.
</p>

<h2>4. Installing Plugins</h2>
<p>
  When you're installing a plugin, refer to its documentation.  The 
  documentation could be in a README file, but more likely it's in
  the plugin code itself at the top of the file.  This documentation should
  tell you how to install the plugin, what template variables the plugin
  exposes, how to invoke the plugin, how to get in touch with the author
  should you find bugs or need help, and any additional things you should
  know about. 
</p>
<p>
  Most plugins should have a pretty easy installation method.  You should
  be able to copy the plugin into the directory defined in your
  <code>config.py</code> file in the <code>plugin_dirs</code> property.
  Then there might be some additional properties you'll ahve to set in your
  <code>config.py</code> file to define the plugin's behavior.  That
  should be about it.  On some occasions, you may have to change the code
  in the plugin itself to meet your specific needs.
</p>

<h2>5. Writing Your Own Plugins</h2>
<p>
  You may find that you desire functionality and there is no plugin that
  anyone knows about that performs that functionality.  It's probably
  best at this point for you to either pay someone to write the plugin you
  need or write it yourself.
</p>
<p>
  Plugins are pretty easy to write and can cover a lot of really different 
  functionality.  The best way to learn how to write PyBlosxom plugins 
  is to read through the plugins in the plugin registry.  Many of them are
  well written and may provide insight as to how to solve your specific
  problem.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, feel free to ask for help on the pyblosxom-users and
  pyblosxom-devel mailing lists.
